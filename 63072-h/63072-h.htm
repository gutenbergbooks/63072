</h2>

<p>September had come and gone, leaving the desert brown and somber against
the graying sage. The first of the cold rains had fallen. Round-up time
was past. The cattle left in the hills were moving down to lower
pastures. Unerringly they sensed the brief Indian summer yet to come,
which would turn the grasses green for a few brief days before the cold,
snow-bringing winds of late October were upon them.</p>

<p>There was that in the air on the range which said the year’s work was
over.... The world was waiting. But in the little towns plumped down
beside the shining rails of the Espee and the Western Pacific, all was
activity and bustle. The steer shipping was on and the held-over wool
clip was going aboard the cars. It was the harvest time of the mountain
desert—the pay day of the range.</p>

<p>Pockets were well lined. There had been famine—days on end of hard work,
of no spending. Now was the time of plenty, of satisfied appetites.
Winnemucca, Golconda, Elko, Halleck, Standing Rock, in the heart of Ruby
Valley—they were all alike—boisterous, turbulent, prosperous; save that
Standing Rock, newer than its sister towns, was more boisterous, more
continuously turbulent, and less concerned with its future prosperity.</p>

<p>And yet there was one who entered its hospitable gates this late
afternoon who seemed untouched by its gayety. His eyes, screwed into the
perpetual squint of the true desert breed, viewed Standing Rock’s
activities with apparent unconcern. It was an old story to him. He knew
the desert’s little ways!</p>

<p>His coming caused no comment. And this, despite the fact that his
clothes were of an almost forgotten cut, popular in the days when Dodge
City reaped its harvest from the great northward trek of the longhorns.</p>

<p>The Big Trek is a thing of the past; the trail itself lost, forgotten.
Dodge City has long since settled down to most proper respectability.
And those hard-fisted, quick-shooting men who squandered their wealth
and lives, there, along the way from Santa Fe, have departed to that
limbo from which none return.</p>

<p>But a practiced eye would have said that the man who rode into Standing
Rock this day was of that crew. His face was a fighting face, withal he
was on in years, gray hair closely snugged to his head. In other days he
had been a rugged man; but there was a sadness upon him now, a
wistfulness in the eyes, that softened his boldly chiseled features.</p>

<p>That he moved unnoticed is proof again that our one cosmopolitan zone
has ever been the great West. Spurs, bridle, saddlebags, reata, even the
big, high-stepping stallion which he rode were foreign to northern
Nevada. That they were Spanish or Mexican—the difference is slight in
the West—no one cared a hoot. The desert is wide. Men have a habit of
coming long distances, and from strange places. And best—far best of
all—a man’s business was his own business!</p>

<p>The two trunk lines paralleled each other in passing through the town.
In the short half mile between them, Standing Rock took form; half
finished, half painted—a one-street town of one story buildings making a
brave show with their Cripple Creek fronts.</p>

<p>Hard by the Espee tracks this monotonously regular sky line was broken.
For there, wonder of wonders, stood a two-story brick structure—a
hotel!—the pride of Ruby Valley; the Marble Palace; J. Scanlon and V.
Escondido, proprietors.</p>

<p>Steer and wool money had financed it, hence Vincenzo. He was a petulant
Basque, and although in the storied past he and his people had sprung
from stock as Celtic as his partner’s, he—Vincenzo—was in a fair way of
being erased by the versatile Scanlon. In quite the same fashion their
institution had lost its chilling and undeserved title—unless the
marble-topped bar were justification—and was called, in easy
familiarity, the Palace.</p>

<p>The profits of this establishment were restricted solely to the first
floor, for, save at times like this, or when some unfortunate commercial
traveler missed No. 19 going west, no one ever thought of staying there
the night. But, oh, the profits of that lower floor!—bar and keno,
roulette and poker of a flexibility well calculated to satisfy the whim
of the most jaded customer.</p>

<p>Having stabled his horse and placed his saddle, saddlebags and bed roll
on a convenient peg, the stranger made for the door of this hostelry. It
was a few minutes after five. The Diamond-Bar waddies were having their
turn at the shipping pens. An hour later they would be making merry.
Now, though, the street was deserted. The wool platform was directly in
back of the hotel. The spur of track leading to it managed to squeeze
past the hotel by the narrowest of margins.</p>

<p>Four loaded cars stood on the siding. By six o’clock another would be
filled. A freight engine would shunt them upon the main line that
evening, and start them on their long ride to Boston.</p>

<p>For another week this would go on. At least twenty heavy freighters,
piled high with baled wool still reeking of the creosote dip, stood in
the space about the platform waiting to be unloaded. More would come.
Twenty-mule teams dragging three, and even four, wagons chained together
would snake in the smelling fleece.</p>

<p>Standing Rock should have been a place of ample elbow room, but here, in
man’s peculiar way, was its greatest activity jammed in a space so
crowded that the stranger stopped to watch the Basque boys as they
fought the big bales with their long, steel wool hooks.</p>

<p>His interest in the work on the platform caught the attention of a man
who sat in the Palace bar, feet on the window sill, chair tilted back in
comfort. This man had been sitting there some time, busy with strings of
figures on the pages of a small leather-covered memorandum book. This
occupation had absorbed his entire attention for many minutes; but as he
stared at the stranger standing beside the track the little book fell
from his fingers. Almost with one motion his feet came down from the
sill and the chair to its four legs. His face was white when he
straightened from snatching for the little book.</p>

<p>He darted another glance at the stranger, as if doubting his senses. He
had made no mistake! His hand trembled as he pushed the chair out of his
path.</p>

<p>“It’s him,” he muttered. “Traynor!”</p>

<p>A belated sense of caution caused him to sweep the room with his eyes to
see if any one had observed his ill-concealed alarm. A sigh of relief
forced itself to his lips as he saw that Escondido, the Basque
proprietor, was his only companion. Vin was hunched over the bar, his
head resting in his arms, sound asleep.</p>

<p>A rear door led to the wool platform. The man tiptoed to it quickly, and
without a backward glance passed outside. A second later the stranger
was shaking Vin back to consciousness.</p>

<p>“I want a room, <i>muchacho</i>” he said with some impatience.</p>

<p>Vin blinked his eyes. “No room, <i>señor</i>. Theese hotel is feel up. Plenty
men in town.”</p>

<p>“I’m not stayin’ all night. It’s goin’ to rain. I’ll go on after the
stormin’s done. You let me have one of the boys’ rooms. They won’t be
turnin’ in till late. I’m dead tired.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Mike! I guess we feex leetla theeng like that. You take the end
room. I call you nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>The Basque turned to fish out from a pile of soiled papers a dilapidated
book which served the place as a register.</p>

<p>“You put your name in theese book, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>He held it toward the man, pencil in his free hand. The stranger’s eyes
held Vin’s as he took the book and pencil; but instead of writing as
requested, he closed the book and put the pencil on top of it, after
which he placed them with extravagant care on the polished bar.</p>

<p>Vin started to protest, but the man’s squinting, smiling gray eyes made
him pause. Damn these gringoes when they smile!</p>

<p>“No,” the stranger was saying. “<i>Niente, señor.</i> I’ve just clean fergot
how to write. You understand?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí, sí.</i>” Escondido was not lying. He understood the <i>eyes</i>. It was
sufficient. Then, with a shrug of the shoulders and a grin: “Me, I
pretty dam’ well ferget how to read somethings, too.”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor</i>, you are a man of wisdom.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, having removed his boots and draped his gun belt
and hat over a convenient chair, the man was asleep. Neither the noise
from the platform nor the heavy smell of creosote drifting in through
the open window disturbed him. He had been in the saddle twelve hours
that day.</p>

<p>The freshening wind and the gathering clouds to the north bore
unmistakable promise of approaching storm. This would have caused him no
concern. He had foreseen it and molded his plans to its whim. A
conversation going on in a cabin across the tracks would have been of
infinitely more interest. He was the subject of that talk; one of the
two thus engaged being the man who had stolen out of the Palace bar.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s him,” he repeated doggedly from time to time. “Ain’t no
ghosts scarin’ me thataway. It’s Crosbie Traynor.”</p>

<p>“And him dead these twenty years?”</p>

<p>“I thought he was dead. Men left on the Painted Desert without water and
no food don’t come back. He’s done it, though! It’s him. Still wearin’
one of my old hats—the one with that Moqui horsehair band. You
remember—had a gold snake luck piece snapped on to the band. I tell you
he looks like the livin’ spit of the way he did that night down on the
Little Colorado.”</p>

<p>His companion said nothing, but the sweat of fear had broken on his
forehead. Crosbie Traynor’s return to the land of living men was as
ominous as those black clouds gathering to the north. Death walked in
the air.</p>

<p>The little schemes, the plotting, the treachery of twenty years now
crumbled to ruins! Not for a second was it to be supposed that Traynor
had come to Standing Rock by accident. The man’s country lay far to the
south, hundreds of miles. Yes, it was his way to ferret them out, to
hang on, drifting from town to town until he tracked them down.</p>

<p>“Damn you for a bungling fool!” cursed the brooding one. The man from
the hotel sank lower into his chair, spineless, impotent in the face of
that ghost-man’s visit. He raised his hands to shield his eyes from his
companion’s wrath as the other went on:</p>

<p>“A bungling, white-livered fool! That’s what you are! Now we’ll be lucky
if our necks don’t get stretched.”</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“Do?” The man got to his feet and shook his fist in his visitor’s face.
“I’m going to do what you tried to do. I’m going to get Traynor before
he gets me. Is that plain enough for you?”</p>

<p>“You—you goin’ to kill him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bah!” the other hurled back with fine contempt. “That scares you,
huh? Where’ll you be if he ever gets wind of you? That makes you shiver,
eh? Well, you get this idea under your hat and let it stick there—you’re
taking orders from me. ‘Cross’ Traynor is going to be erased!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Darkness came, bringing the day’s work to an end. The commotion on the
wool platform ceased. Down the tracks from the direction of the shipping
pens came the Diamond-Bar boys. They had just put ten hours of hard work
behind them, but one would not have guessed it from their present
vociferousness.</p>

<p>Johnny Allerdyce, or rather Johnny Dice—to give him what he called his
“<i>nom devoid</i>”—led the column headed for the Palace. He was walking the
ties, taking three of them at a step. Behind him some fifteen of his
pals were strung out at varying intervals.</p>

<p>Johnny’s legs were pronouncedly bowed from his life in a saddle, and
this long-stepping walk, or half run, only accentuated his deformity.
Big hat flapping in the wind, the tails of his neckerchief flattening
out behind him, made him seem grotesque. But there was action in every
line of him, untouched vitality. Freckled face, untamed hair of flaming
hue—they were fit companions for his dancing, mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>“Hi, hi, you gamblin’ fool,” some one in back of him yelled. “I hope you
stub your toe and break yore damned haid. You let me know how the town
is when you git there!”</p>

<p>“You tell him, cowboy!” Johnny flung over his shoulder. “I crave food
and pleasure!”</p>

<p>Laughter of marked contempt greeted this retort. Somebody cried: “Liar!”
Johnny was strictly a night-blooming plant; this talk of food was just
talk.</p>

<p>At the hotel, Vin was going about lighting the lamps. No one ever locked
a door. In turn, he left a light in Crosbie Traynor’s room. The sleeper
had not moved. Vin surveyed him calmly, wondering if he had ever seen
the man before. Without his hat, Traynor seemed older. Vincenzo shrugged
his shoulders as he turned away. The man was a total stranger to him.
And still this mysterious <i>señor</i> aroused the Basque’s curiosity.</p>

<p>Vin had been on the desert too long not to have learned the wisdom of
keeping his own counsel; but he took much pleasure from building
romantic adventures around his guests. Some <i>señors</i> there had been who
were in great haste. He had sped them on their way. But they were not
forgotten.</p>

<p>This man was in no seeming haste, but something about him sent delicious
little chills racing up and down Vin’s spine. He would have spent more
time on the matter had not Scanlon called to him at the moment. Johnny
and the other Diamond-Bar warriors had arrived. In this democratic inn
the proprietors—or to be exact, one of them—served the meals. His name
was not Scanlon, that individual confining his efforts to the well-known
cash register and the dealing of much poker.</p>

<p>Jackson Kent, the big boss of the Diamond-Bar, came in before supper was
over. He was a hawk-faced old man, silent as a rule. Hobe Ferris, his
foreman, was with him. Pushing back the knife and fork set before him,
the old man began stacking five, ten, and twenty dollar gold pieces into
neat little piles. This was pay night.</p>

<p>Some of the boys had not drawn a cent in three months. Hobe called off
their names and the amounts due, and old man Kent counted it out to them
as they filed past. The owner of the Diamond-Bar caressed his little
stacks of gold pieces with his fingers as the piles grew smaller and
smaller. He caught Scanlon eyeing him.</p>

<p>“Might jest as well be payin’ him,” he muttered to Hobe, shaking his
head regretfully. “What a waste of good money this is,” he added. “Won’t
a one of ’em have a cent left time they git back to the ranch.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t includin’ Johnny in that remark, be you?” Hobe demanded.
“Ain’t one of the boys but owes him plenty cash right now. He’ll git
more of their jack tonight.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the old man grunted. “Huh!” His contempt for Johnny’s genius was
of long standing. “Somebody’ll git him jest like he gits these fools.
Gamblin’s made a smart aleck out of him. Always figurin’ how things is
goin’ to break; talkin’ his head off about the laws of chance. Jest
spoiled a good hand, that’s all gamblin’s done to Johnny Dice. His mind
ain’t on cattle no more. Damn it, Hobe, half the time I believe he don’t
know whether he’s runnin’ sheep or steers.”</p>

<p>Hobe was a good foreman, so he wisely agreed with the old man. He had
been doing this for ten years; a time in which the Diamond-Bar had
prospered.</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em git too drunk, Hobe,” Kent cautioned as he began his
supper. “We got work to do tomorrow mornin’. The Lawrence boys will be
here with their stuff by noon. We’ve got to git out of the way.”</p>

<p>Hobe nodded as he strolled to the bar. “We’ll be in the clear, I
reckon,” he drawled. “Hain’t had no trouble yit.”</p>

<p>Hobe Ferris had long since forgotten the knack of smiling, but he almost
remembered it as he thought of the old man’s concern for his men.</p>

<p>“Old age certainly uses y’u up, don’t it?” he mused. “Yes, sir! Think of
him worryin’ thataway. If this keeps up, Miss Molly’ll be bossin’ the
brand ’fore long.”</p>

<p>Ferris looked about for Johnny, but he and his pal, Tony Madeiras, had
gone down the street. There were other places of chance in Standing
Rock, and wise Johnny was off to a picking.</p>

<p>Stuffy Tyler, who had raced through his supper and who had been busy
ever since refreshing himself at the bar, greeted his foreman with a
hearty smack on the back.</p>

<p>“Y’u again?” Hobe queried.</p>

<p>“Little me, Hobe.”</p>

<p>And then, without further ado, he roared that old range song, the first
two lines of which run:</p>

<div class='poetry-container'>
<div class='poetry'>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='verse'>“Oh, no, Jenny!</div>
<div class='verse'>What would yore father say?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hobe knew what father said, and he was not minded to listen to his
complaint this night. A wooden awning stretched across the walk in front
of the hotel. There, the foreman found refuge from Stuffy’s bawling.</p>

<p>The storm clouds which had been gathering to the north had circled round
to the west; but they were nearer now. Far away, a mile or more, the
steel rails of the Espee main line began to dance in the glow of a
powerful headlight. A second later the light itself appeared. It was the
freight that would roll away with those loaded cars of wool and those
others filled with Diamond-Bar’s steers.</p>

<p>For a brief moment the light seemed to pause there on the brink of the
wide valley. Another second and it was dashing down upon Standing Rock.</p>

<p>Its coming was dramatic, and it held Hobe’s attention. Suddenly the
speeding circle of light was dimmed. It was rain. Not a drop had fallen,
as yet, where he sat. But there, a quarter of a mile away, was the
coming storm, racing the train into town.</p>

<p>The engineer blew for the station before the rain began to spatter down
in the dry dust of the street in front of the hotel. A few seconds later
the big mogul engine, panting and puffing, came to a grinding stop
fifteen feet from where Ferris sat.</p>

<p>Inside the hotel things were humming. Scanlon was playing cards; Yin was
hammering a staccato tune on the cash register. Two partners could
hardly have been more profitably engaged.</p>

<p>A man skulking in the shadows across the tracks wondered at the big
fellow sitting there on the porch, getting wet beyond a doubt,
refraining from joining the sport of his pals. He had recognized the big
man as Ferris. For the second time he wondered if the foreman by any
chance might be watching him.</p>

<p>The storm became heavier. The high wind in back of it began to send the
rain with such force that the wooden awning no longer offered any
protection. Reluctantly, Hobe arose and went inside.</p>

<p>The man, who had been waiting for him to go in, speedily crossed the
tracks and made for the wool platform in back of the hotel. For a person
of his age, he was spry. Picking up a wool hook, he noiselessly climbed
over the tops of the loaded freighters until he was abreast one of the
freight cars.</p>

<p>With remarkable quickness he crawled to the top of it. Flat on his
stomach he lay, peering into the darkness, trying to make certain that
his movements were unwatched. The rain beat into his face so violently
that he had to raise his hand to protect his eyes.</p>

<p>His roving glance found nothing to disturb him. In the inky blackness
the warehouse beside the platform bulked dark and forbidding. From its
protecting shadows to where he lay now his path had not crossed any
chance ray of light.</p>

<p>Turning on his side, he surveyed the hotel. Curtains flapped in the
second story windows; flickering yellow light streamed through them. The
wind eddied every now and then, bidding fair to extinguish the lamps Vin
had lighted; but, with the persistency of oil wicks, they fluttered on.</p>

<p>A thankful curse escaped the man as he observed the open windows. He
wondered why Vin had not been up to close them. He knew the Basque’s
habits.</p>

<p>Far down the track at the shipping pens the train crew was switching the
loaded cars. Ten minutes and they would be back here, moving this very
car on which he lay. Ten minutes—it was enough. He had but to walk these
five loaded wool cars to sweep the interior of the Palace Hotel. If the
man he sought slept within—well, it wouldn’t take ten minutes to finish
this little errand.</p>

<p>From the edge of the big freight cars he could reach out and touch the
wall of the hotel. Grasping the steel hook with which he had provided
himself, he began to move toward the lighted windows.</p>

<p>Seconds slipped by as he came abreast the first window before he
satisfied himself that the room was unoccupied. On hands and knees,
drawing himself forward noiselessly, he crept on. An even longer time
did he pause before passing the second window. He began to wonder if the
man he sought had gone downstairs. He knew he had been in his room
twenty minutes ago. Rather, he had believed as much, inasmuch as the man
had not been in the bar.</p>

<p>Subconsciously he became aware of the approaching engine. It drove him
forward. With half the caution he had used in surveying the other rooms,
he stared into the third one. Something stuck in his throat as he beheld
Crosbie Traynor sound asleep on the narrow bed, his head within a foot
of the window.</p>

<p>Black hatred leaped in the man’s soul as he stared at the sleeping
Traynor. This was going to be almost too easy! There had been moments in
his approach to this spot in which his determination to go through with
his mission had wavered; his hands had shaken.</p>

<p>That was gone now. He not only wanted to kill, but he found himself able
to restrain his desire—to snuggle it to his heart, to wait for the
propitious second, to do the deed cleverly. It was a revelation to the
man. He had never suspected himself of such metal.</p>

<p>He had drawn his gun, but he put it back. Wisdom was guiding him. The
long steel wool hook became his weapon. Reaching into the room with it,
he picked Traynor’s belt and loaded holster from its perch on the chair
beside the bed. Next he secured the hat the sleeping man had worn.</p>

<p>The feel of it infuriated him. Savagely he ripped away the band and the
gold charm snapped into it. He threw the hat back into the room. It
would have pleased him to have hurled the little gold snake into the
blackness, but that was the very sort of thing he had told himself a
minute ago he had mastered. So the little charm went into his pocket.</p>

<p>With the steel hook, he replaced Traynor’s gun belt, minus the gun. The
engine, with its string of cattle cars, bumped into the line of cars on
which he lay as he drew back from depositing the holster. For a second
he wavered, fighting to regain his balance. He could hear the air
shooting through the brakes. This car would be moving in another moment.
A brakeman ran down alongside the train. Thanks to the rain he had not
come across the tops!</p>

<p>Some one shouted, a lantern waved, the train tensed as if to spring
forward. A grinding, tearing sound, the lurching of the big car, and
then the long-drawn, piercing whistle.</p>

<p>It was for this he had waited. Reaching in through the window, he fired!</p>

<p>Gloating, wholly evil, the murderer’s face gleamed in the streaming
light. The train was moving—taking him away to safety. The sound of the
shot has been lost, dimmed by the noise of the storm and the piercing
blast of the whistle.</p>

<p>He had played it to the last line! Cross Traynor had been erased.
There’d be no coming back this time. He saw him half out of bed, his
head on the floor—a gory relic of what had been a man.</p>

<p>With an easy toss the killer dropped the dead man’s gun to the floor
beside the body. That was the last, final touch! It made the slayer
smile.</p>

<p>“That’s that, I guess. Dead—and by his own gun, too! Cross, you’ll never
come back now.”</p>

<p>The train was gathering speed. The man flattened himself out. At the
shipping pens the freight moved upon the main track. This slowing down
was the awaited moment. Unseen, the man who had killed so easily slipped
to the ground. The wool hook which had served him so well was tossed
into the sage. Then, with sure step, he moved away in the night. This
affair was a thing of the past. Who was there to question him?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chIII' title='III: BY HIS OWN HAND'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>BY HIS OWN HAND</span>
</h2>

<p>In the Palace bar all was merry. To the casual eye Scanlon might have
appeared an exception, a frosted flower in a garden of flaming blooms;
but even his moroseness was giving way to a sly smile. Four mysterious
aces had but recently appeared in Stub Rawlings’s hand. The Scanlon bank
roll had been severely injured. The source of that handful of cards had
sorely troubled the red-headed boss of the Palace. He had become
conscious of the storm raging without, but he had not so much as cast a
glance at the streaming windows. Mr. Rawlings’s play was of greater
interest.</p>

<p>Lady Luck began to smile on the house. Scanlon’s stack of blue chips
increased to dizzy heights. He now held Mr. Rawlings’s aces. He played
them much better than Stub had. In fact, so well did he maneuver that
when the Diamond-Bar man called, the game was over as far as Stub was
concerned.</p>

<p>In the interval Scanlon flashed questioning eyes at the windows.
Impatiently then he called to Vin: “The windows, Vin! Upstairs—shut the
windows! This damn place’ll be floatin’ away if you don’t.”</p>

<p>Vin had been much the busier of the two. But that was as usual. He
scowled now, though. Scanlon had been piling straws on the Basque’s back
for some years. This threatened to be the one too many. Tomorrow he
would brood over any damage done to the hotel; but now he was angry only
with Scanlon. “<i>Madre de Dios!</i>” he growled. “I do all these worries for
theese firm. I scrub those floors, I mak’ those bed, I wash those
window—by Chris’, I not close them.”</p>

<p>“Aw, go on, Vinnie,” the boisterous Stuffy exclaimed, “and be damn glad
you ain’t livin’ in Awregon where they really got rain.”</p>

<p>“That’s him!” Scanlon snorted. “Always tellin’ what he does round here.
Jest workin’ yerself to death, ain’t yuh? Humph! If it wasn’t fer my
brains we wouldn’t have no hotel.” He turned back to his game. “Let ’er
rain,” he roared. “I can swim.”</p>

<p>This indifference to their mutual prosperity seared the Basque’s soul,
but he rolled up his apron and started for the stairs, the air blue with
his cursing. “By damn, I soon git my own hotel, you Irish gringo!” he
hurled at his partner.</p>

<p>The crowd tittered. Vin’s troubles were well understood. A moment later
the Basque was back at the head of the stairs, white of face, hands
shaking.</p>

<p>“<i>Socorro</i>—help! Man ees keel heemself! I guess you come like hell now,
Scanlon.”</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the crowded barroom. Little noises were stilled until
only the soft slip-slip of the cards running through Scanlon’s fingers
broke the silence. Sudden, or mysterious, death was quite as chilling in
Standing Rock as in more sophisticated circles.</p>

<p>The tension held for a brief spell. Hobe Ferris was the first to move. A
moment later the crowd was pouring up the stairs.</p>

<p>Traynor lay as the killer had left him—half out of bed, his gun near his
lifeless hand.</p>

<p>Scanlon bent over and examined the powder marks on the man’s forehead.
“Never seen him before,” said he as he straightened up. “This is
Stuffy’s room, Vin. How’d <i>he</i> git up here?”</p>

<p>“Man came ’fore supper. Say he only want to sleep till the rain ees
past. I say take theese room. What diff’rence eet make? Stuffy not go to
baid tonight.”</p>

<p>“You said somethin’, Vinnie. I ain’t ever goin’ to sleep in <i>that</i> bed.”</p>

<p>“Dry up,” Hobe ordered. “We’d better git Doc Ritter. The doc and the old
man are playin’ pinochle in his office. I saw ’em across the street. Run
over and git him, Stub.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no need gittin’ a doctor,” Scanlon said positively. “This is a
job for the coroner. The man’s as dead as a man can git. Gallup is the
only one that can be of any use here.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, I guess yo’re right, Scanlon. Fine lookin’ man, that. Wonder where
he came from? Ain’t none of y’u boys ever seen him?”</p>

<p>The crowd edged closer to the dead man; but no one seemed to remember
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll go for Gallup,” Stub offered. “He’ll sure be riled, gittin’ out of
bed this time of the night. He goes to the hay with the chickens.”</p>

<p>Stub’s going seemed to unloosen the crowd’s tongue. A dozen conjectures
were voiced, and either denied or affirmed. Hobe brought them up,
standing, by his discovery that no one had heard the shot which had
killed the man.</p>

<p>Scanlon turned on his partner, his mouth sagging a trifle. This thing
had a queer draw to it. “Vin,” he argued, “you ain’t been out of the
house. Didn’t you hear nothin’?”</p>

<p>“I don’ hear anyt’ing. But theese <i>señor</i> have foony look in hees eye.
Mak’ me feel leetla chill in the back. I ask hees name; <i>Caramba!</i> He
say he ees pretty well forget how to mak’ those writings in book.”</p>

<p>“Sort of a mysterious gent, eh?” Scanlon asked, unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“His name’s his own business,” Hobe flared back. “He might have been
considerate enough to bump hisself off somewheres else; but I pretty
well wouldn’t like to have anybody tellin’ me my name wa’n’t my own
business.”</p>

<p>The Diamond-Bar foreman rightly suspected that Scanlon’s annoyance was
largely due to the fact that this affair would throw a wet blanket on
the spending of money. He had been waiting some three months for this
harvest.</p>

<p>Gallup, the coroner, and Stub returned at this moment, and Scanlon was
saved replying to the challenge in Hobe’s words.</p>

<p>“What’s all the trouble?” Gallup demanded when he had entered the room.</p>

<p>“It’s a job for you, Aaron,” Ferris replied. “Vin just found him a few
minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Gallup surveyed the dead man.</p>

<p>“Humph! Did a good job, didn’t he? Guess he wouldn’t ’a’ been no deader
in the mornin’. Gittin’ so I can’t git a good night’s sleep no more.”</p>

<p>“Yo’re still drawin’ down yore wages reg’lar, ain’t yuh?”</p>

<p>Old Aaron wiped his nose with the back of his hand at this query from
Ferris.</p>

<p>“Sorta reg’lar, Hobe,” Gallup answered with a wise little smile. “All
due to me, though. Any man that can git fifteen hundred a year out of
this county has earned it. If you folks ever start raisin’ my wages I’m
goin’ to quit cold.”</p>

<p>While he talked, Gallup had been examining the dead man’s clothes and
his gun.</p>

<p>“This bird sure knew what he was doin’,” he muttered. “Ain’t a mark on
him to identify him. Queer old gun he used. Well, we got men enough
here. I guess I’ll swear you in and git done right now.”</p>

<p>“We’re shy one, Aaron,” said Hobe. “Where’s Johnny? Ought to have him,
he’s so <i>up</i> on these things.”</p>

<p>“Him and Tony’s over to the Bud. They’ll be comin’ soon as the news gits
round.”</p>

<p>“I got enough,” Aaron answered. “Johnny Dice ain’t law-abidin’ no more,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>Without further delay he began swearing them to the truth. Before he had
finished the jingle of spur chains below caught Scanlon’s ear. “There’s
someone now.” He went to the stairs and looked down. “Say, Johnny,
you’re just in time. Need another man up here.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing, old dear. What’s the limit?”</p>

<p>“No limit. It’s a dead man. Gallup’s here.”</p>

<p>“Do I know him?” demanded Johnny.</p>

<p>“No one’s ever clapped eyes on him ’cept Vin. But he don’t know nothin’,
either.”</p>

<p>Johnny had stopped to shake the rain from his hat. He turned now to
Madeiras. “Come on, Tony. What you grumblin’ about?”</p>

<p>Tony smiled. “I t’ought Scanlon say Gallup ees daid.”</p>

<p>“You sound disappointed. What you cookin’ up for old Aaron?”</p>

<p>“You forget my name, Johnny. I am a Madeiras. There ees lots of
Madeiras.”</p>

<p>“Still thinkin’ ’bout that, eh? You best tell your people not to borrow
no money from Aaron. He’s a money hound, boy. I tell yuh he knows those
gents on the greenbacks personal.”</p>

<p>Tony tapped his chest. “Somet’ings we don’t forget, Johnny.”</p>

<p>They were upstairs by this time. Aaron scowled at the Basque, but he
chose him in preference to Johnny.</p>

<p>“One of you is all I need,” the old man muttered. Johnny was defeated,
but not stilled.</p>

<p>“They certainly keep you busy, don’t they, Aaron?” he asked provokingly.</p>

<p>“That’ll be enough talk from you, Johnny,” Gallup snapped. “If you want
to stay in the room you keep still.”</p>

<p>“Serves me right. The idea of a loose character like me tryin’ to edge
in on the law! Ain’t no hard feelin’s on my part, Aaron.”</p>

<p>The old man ignored this sally.</p>

<p>“Now, Vinnie, you tell us how you found this man,” he began in a more or
less official manner.</p>

<p>Vin explained how he had come up to close the windows, and so forth.</p>

<p>“You hain’t touched nothin’?”</p>

<p>“No, I call downstairs right away I see he ees daid.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Nobody here knows this man, either, eh?” He cleared his throat
importantly. “Well, gentlemen, there don’t seem to be no use wastin’ any
more time. This man came here intendin’ to kill himself. It ain’t
accidental-like for a man to go round without some mark of
identification on him. He cut off every sign by which he might be
traced. He’s got his watch and his money; so it wa’n’t robbery. And you
all see where the powder burned his forehead. The gun’s there on the
floor, just where he dropped it, too. Guess that makes the answer plain.
Best you bring in the usual verdict; death by his own hand, this day and
date. That agreed?”</p>

<p>A muttered chorus of assenting grunts greeted him as he began making out
the death certificate.</p>

<p>“Say, Aaron,” Johnny interrupted. “There’s somethin’ under the bed. The
man’s hat, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Aaron glanced at him over the rims of his glasses.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wait a little longer? You ain’t tongue-tied, be yuh?”</p>

<p>“You told me to shut up.”</p>

<p>“Little good comes from tellin’ you.”</p>

<p>The old man grunted as he crawled beneath the bed to recover the hat.</p>

<p>“It’s a hat, all right,” he grumbled. “His hat, no doubt. Ain’t a mark
on it, though.” He held it up for his jury to gaze at it. “Jest about
proves what I contend. The man wanted to die unidentified.”</p>

<p>Tony Madeiras’s eyes bulged as he saw the hat Gallup held aloft. Pushing
his way forward he took the hat in his hand. Gallup watched him closely.</p>

<p>“Son of a gun!” Madeiras exclaimed slowly and turned to face his
friends. “I change my min’ about those daid man. I know thees hat!”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>“<i>Sí.</i> I know thees hat. Only t’ree, four days ago I see eet.”</p>

<p>“Yeh!” There was open doubt of the Basque puncher’s word in the
coroner’s voice. “You remember a hat without a band or mark on it that
you saw three or four days ago? It ain’t even a grown-up hat. It’s just
a little runt of a thing. But you remember it, Madeiras?”</p>

<p>Tony’s eyes narrowed as he answered the old man. “I said I remember
theese hat.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got some memory, bosco.”</p>

<p>Big Hobe put his hand upon Gallup’s shoulder as the coroner gave tongue
to the western term of contempt for the Basque.</p>

<p>“Listen here, Aaron. You won’t make no friends for yoreself with that
kind of talk. This Diamond-Bar bunch don’t exactly like to hear Tony
called a bosco. It ain’t good for the health to say it more than once.
You git that? Now if Tony allows he remembers that hat it ain’t up to
you to call him a liar.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Hobe,” Tony smiled. “Maybe some time he find out my
people have pretty damn good memory. What he thinks, I don’t care. But
for you, Hobe: last Monday I was on the North Fork. Evening time I come
down to the river. Theese man be there. He have plenty hair on hees face
then. Big whiskers. He spik Spanish. Ask lots of question. Me, I ask
some, too. He come long ways theese man.”</p>

<p>“You find out his name?”</p>

<p>“Tony Madeiras don’ ask man hees name.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tony,” Johnny called. “It ain’t bein’ done.”</p>

<p>Gallup turned on Johnny with face flaming.</p>

<p>“If I hear any more talk from you, out you go. This is your crowd, but
the law is the law, and I ain’t goin’ to stand no impudence from you.”</p>

<p>Doc Ritter and Jackson Kent came in as Gallup admonished Johnny. The
coroner nodded to Kent.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can put some sense into him,” he said, pointing to Johnny
Dice.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Johnny?” asked Kent. “We just heard a man had killed
himself up here.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ the matter with me. Gallup’s runnin’ things here. And he ain’t
makin’ no hit with it, either. Hobe had to call him a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gallup’s a good man, boys. Don’t rear and tear too much. Jest what
is wrong, Aaron?”</p>

<p>When Gallup had finished explaining; the Diamond-Bar owner did his best
to restore harmony.</p>

<p>“Now you go on, Tony, and tell the coroner what you know,” he said,
pleadingly. “We don’t want no run-in with the law.”</p>

<p>“That’s sense,” Gallup seconded. “If you saw this man, and talked with
him, tell us what he said.”</p>

<p>“Well, he say—er—he say——” Johnny Dice was coughing so violently that
Tony could not go on. The Basque turned on his pal questioningly. Johnny
was bent nearly double; but Tony caught the wink and the slight shake of
the head which were meant for him. He started to speak again:</p>

<p>“Well, he say how ees the cattle? How ees the water? How ees the sheep?
How ees——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about that,” Gallup growled. “Did he say anythin’ that has
any bearin’ on this case? We ain’t interested in anythin’ else.”</p>

<p>“No—I guess not. All he say ees how ees these, how ees that?”</p>

<p>“Then all this talk’s been for nothin’. What do you say, men? Are you
satisfied it’s suicide or not? Raise your hands if you are.”</p>

<p>Tony saw that Johnny was telling him to say yes. When the Basque’s hand
went up, Gallup turned to Doc Ritter.</p>

<p>“Here’s your papers, doc. Take the body any time you want to.”</p>

<p>Aaron scrawled his signature and handed the certificate to the town’s
doctor and undertaker.</p>

<p>Gallup read aloud:</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p>“Party unknown. Died this 4th of October by his own hand; no reason
given. The foregoing being the sworn verdict of the jury convened by me
on this day and date.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em'>“(Signed) Aaron Gallup,</div>
<div style='text-align:right'>“Coroner of Shoshone County, State of Nevada.”</div>
</div>

<p>Aaron paused to glance at his listeners. “There it is, gentlemen; in
<i>my</i> own hand.” He smiled superiorly. “Somebody count the man’s money
and we’ll adjourn.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Kent, but the old man was staring at the body.</p>

<p>“You oblige me, Jackson?” Gallup asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he muttered; “let Doc do it. I don’t fancy counting a dead man’s
money.”</p>

<p>Old Aaron smiled. “All right,” he drawled patiently. “Guess Doc ain’t so
finicky. He knows that dead men don’t hurt no one.”</p>

</div>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER IV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>FOOT-LOOSE</span>
</h2>

<p>The crowd began trooping downstairs as Doc put the body back on the bed
and covered it. Johnny Dice shook his head as he turned to follow his
friends. There was something wrong about this affair. He felt it long
before he was able to put his fingers on anything definitely suspicious.
His tilt with Gallup was of no consequence. The old man disliked him
because he refused to take the coroner seriously. And then, too, Johnny
and Tony had been stringing along for some years. Aaron had foreclosed a
small mortgage on one of Tony’s relatives. That made bad blood between
them.</p>

<p>Johnny’s suspicions crystallized as Doc lifted the body. He saw a bit of
evidence that no man on earth could contradict. His nerves began to
tingle. This man had not killed himself!</p>

<p>Gallup caught the grim smile on Johnny’s face.</p>

<p>“What you waitin’ for?” he asked.</p>

<p>Johnny continued to smile provokingly. “Ain’t no one sittin’ up for you
at home, is there, Aaron?”</p>

<p>The old man’s face went scarlet at this continued heckling.</p>

<p>“By God,” he cried, “I wisht I was twenty years younger! You’d stop your
insolence.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Aaron. I forgot that. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Johnny meant it, too. The old man was an almost helpless target. Johnny
stooped to hide his chagrin and picked a little curl of wool from the
floor.</p>

<p>The action had been unpremeditated, but as his fingers closed upon the
tuft of wool it became charged with importance. Too late. Johnny tried
to palm it. Aaron saw him.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re pickin’ up?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“A piece of the golden fleece—I mean the creosoted fleece,” Johnny said
with a laugh. “Want it?”</p>

<p>“’Course not, you idiot.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go downstairs, Johnny,” Kent advised. “You and Gallup
remind me of a pair of clawin’ cats. If you ain’t got no respect for old
age, you ought to have for the law, and them that represents it.”</p>

<p>Something in Kent’s tone made Johnny resent this advice.</p>

<p>“Respect for the law?” he asked. “I’m plumb hostile to law when it gits
as stupid as this. I pick up that bit of wool, and what does it mean to
him? Nothin’! Well, it ought to.”</p>

<p>“How so?” Gallup snapped.</p>

<p>“There ain’t been no sheepman in here tonight. It’s wet outside. The
wind ain’t blowin’ wet wool into this room. How’d that piece of fleece
git here? And while I’m about it, no one has proved to me that this gent
killed hisself. I could have slipped up here and bumped him off while he
slept, held the gun close enough to singe hair, too. Droppin’ it on the
floor as I went out wouldn’t take no brains at all.”</p>

<p>“What you think don’t interest me,” old Aaron said hotly. “Vin was
downstairs. He’d have known if any one came up here.”</p>

<p>“You run along, Johnny,” Kent again urged.</p>

<p>“Somehow I just don’t like bein’ told to mind my own business thataway,”
Johnny flared, losing his own temper. “I want to tell Doc and the rest
of you that that man couldn’t have killed hisself—leastwise, not like
this.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t?” Doc Ritter echoed.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said—couldn’t! That bird was a left-handed gent.
Left-handed men ain’t shootin’ themselves in the right temple! ‘By his
own hand’!” Johnny repeated Gallup’s words with fine contempt. “Oh,
hell! Are you fools or what? This man was murdered—shot down in cold
blood!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t nobody but a smart aleck like you tellin’ that a dead man was
left-handed,” the coroner roared.</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t know he was left-handed, then?” Johnny sneered. “You
wouldn’t! You never know! Coroners just don’t. They’re the lowest form
of political infamy. All I got to know about a man is that he’s hired
out to do a job of coronering to know that there ain’t no help for him.”</p>

<p>Gallup’s teeth fairly chattered with rage. Face working convulsively, he
turned to the body as Johnny pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Look at the man’s pants, you old mossback!” Johnny exclaimed,
excitedly. “Ain’t they all wore shiny on the left side just below the
pocket? Nothing but the rubbin’ of his holster against that leg did
that. And that worn-out place beside the pocket—the butt of his gun made
that! Roll him over, Ritter, and let this poor old imbecile have a good
look.”</p>

<p>Doc rolled the body so that they could see if this was so. Gallup’s face
was red with rage. Was this upstart cow-puncher going to cheapen him and
make his work ridiculous? Election wasn’t so far away, said Ritter’s
eyes. Gallup caught the thought.</p>

<p>Old Kent was wringing his hands. Hobe and Tony said nothing, but their
set faces were proof enough that Johnny Dice had dropped a bombshell.</p>

<p>No one seemed willing to break the silence which had crept over them. It
grew so still that Gallup’s little throat noises sounded loud and
ominous. He was weighing matters quite beyond the present trouble with
Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, Johnny,” he said at last in a tone very different from the one he
had previously used, “there may be sense in your contention. No one can
say what was so with a dead man and be sure of it. I never seen him
wearin’ a gun; you never seen him, either. Tell me why anybody’d want to
kill him. Sure wasn’t robbery.”</p>

<p>“Might have been robbery,” Johnny replied. “Forty-six dollars ain’t no
money for a man to have on him in this country. It would have been a
fine stall to have taken his roll and left that measly forty-six. And
then, too, maybe somebody figured he had somethin’ on them. Might be a
dozen reasons.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suspect any one, do you, Johnny?” Doc asked.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to suspect somebody to prove that murder’s been done.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Johnny,” Gallup cut in, “but you ain’t proved that murder’s been
committed. You talk a lot, but it’s all guesswork.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be guesswork very long with me.”</p>

<p>“You git that idea out of yore head,” Kent warned. “If yo’re workin’ for
me you won’t have no time to go runnin’ around doin’ business the county
pays some one else to do.”</p>

<p>Hobe saw the insurgent answer leaping to Johnny’s lips and he tried to
stop it but he was too late.</p>

<p>“If you mean I’ve got the choice of bein’ fired or lettin’ somebody else
do my thinkin’ for me—well, then, I’m fired.”</p>

<p>“Yore words don’t surprise me,” Kent cried. “I told Hobe this evenin’
that you’d bear watchin’.”</p>

<p>“That’s the blow-off,” Johnny said, angrily. “Ridin’ for you ain’t the
thing I’m fondest of.”</p>

<p>“Yo’re talkin’ big now; you got a few dollars in yore pocket. You’ll go
busted quick enough. Takes money to mind other folks’ business.”</p>

<p>“You’re as bad as he is, Jackson,” Ritter interrupted. “I ain’t so sure
the boy isn’t right. If you need any money, Johnny, you let me know.”</p>

<p>This offer of assistance made Gallup chortle.</p>

<p>“I won’t want any money, Doc,” drawled Johnny. “A good horse and a pair
of well-oiled guns are all I’ll need. I’m goin’ to find out who killed
this man. How about it, Tony?”</p>

<p>“Eef you say so, Johnny, she’s so wit’ me.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, you young fool!” Aaron managed to articulate. “Kelsey’s in
Reno. He’ll be back next week. Go see him! Maybe he’ll make you special
investigator for this county.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to see no prosecutin’ attorney!” Johnny’s words clicked
off his tongue. “What I do, I’ll do on my own. If this man was
murdered—by God, I’m goin’ to find out who killed him! It’ll be time
enough to talk of seein’ Kelsey then!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Scanlon’s fear that the night was ruined as far as he was concerned
proved well founded. Gallup paused to buy himself a drink. Kent and his
foreman came down as the coroner went out. Hobe’s face was glum. The old
man’s run-in with Johnny and his pal was only another evidence of his
coming decay. For all of his fault, Johnny was a good man, and a better
<i>vaquero</i> than Madeiras was not to be found this side of the Humboldt.
Kent might figure that, come spring, they would be back asking to be
taken on again. Hobe knew better than this. Johnny’s pride more than
matched his temper.</p>

<p>Times there had been in the past when old Jackson Kent had not balked at
winking an eye at the law. This present deference to it nettled Hobe.
The Diamond-Bar was big and powerful enough to lay down its own law. No
one more than Ferris had built up its traditions. A few men there are
like him who can become so much a part of their work that a subconscious
sense of ownership of the tools with which they toil takes possession of
them. It was that way with Hobe. He was the Diamond-Bar.</p>

<p>Kent’s daughter, Molly, had healed some previous sore spots between the
foreman and the old man, but this arbitrary handling of the Diamond-Bar
men was poaching on authority long since held by the foreman. Kent would
have been hard put to have found a way to hurt the man more.</p>

<p>“You better git the boys to bed,” the old man said.</p>

<p>Hobe’s face was sullen.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” It was the first time in years that Hobe had “sirred” the
boss. Kent looked at him sharply, feeling the implied unfriendliness. He
had the good sense, though, to say nothing.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the barroom was clear of Diamond-Bar men. Stuffy
Tyler had fallen asleep, but big Hobe easily picked him up, and throwing
him over his shoulder as if the man were a sack of meal, carried him to
his bed.</p>

<p>Doc Ritter brought in a stretcher, and with the aid of Johnny and Tony,
the dead man was carried to Ritter’s undertaking parlor.</p>

<p>Scanlon and Vin faced each other.</p>

<p>“Beats hell, don’t it,” the former asked sullenly, “how one man can put
a town to bed? You’d almost think we knew the man—comin’ in here and
dyin’ thata-way. You know what we stand to lose, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“We don’ lose not’in’, Scanlon. Money? We get heem by an’ by. Next
election, though, we lose somet’ing.”</p>

<p>“Gallup, eh? Maybe so. The man ain’t got no ideas. You ’tend to the
lights and close up, Vin. I’m dead tired. I’m goin’ to bed.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em burn,” the Basque snapped. “I can swim!”</p>

<p>Scanlon smiled as he recognized his own words of the early evening. But
Vinnie put out the lights.</p>

<p>For half an hour after the hotel was in darkness, Johnny and Tony sat in
front of the Palace. The rain was over.</p>

<p>“You go to baid, Johnny?” Tony asked.</p>

<p>“No. I couldn’t sleep. Tell me again just what that man said to you that
night on the North Fork.”</p>

<p>The big Basque smiled. He had already told his story twice.</p>

<p>“I jus’ remember I look at hees hat, and he smile. That’s fonny hat, you
know—so small brim, great beeg crown. No mens wear hats like those now.
He geeve it to me for tak’ good look. The ban’ on eet is ver-ry fine.
‘Yes,’ he say, ‘that’s Indian ban’. Moqui Indian mak’ those ban’. Mak’
eet out of horsehair.’</p>

<p>“But more fonny that those hat is little green snake he have fasten on
that ban’. That snake have green eyes. Eet’s a gold snake, too. ‘Press
the haid of that snake,’ he say. <i>Por Dios</i>, that snake fall into my
han’. ‘That’s beeg medicine,’ he say, ‘those snake. Been on that hat
forty year!’</p>

<p>“‘Why you wear those old hat?’ I ask. He tell me; but he don’ smile.
‘Plenty hats like theese, long time ago in Santa Fe and Tombstone,’ he
say. ‘Some day I fin’ the man what owns theese hat. He’ll remember
eet!’”</p>

<p>“Yuh can’t git away from it, Tony,” Johnny exclaimed. “He was lookin’
for somebody, and that somebody got him. Horsehair hat-bands ain’t
uncommon. He wouldn’t have ripped it off his hat to keep folks from
rememberin’ it. That Indian snake was what he’d have hid and he’d have
unsnapped it and put it in his pants. But it’s against all sense to
believe that he took off even the snake. He wanted to be recognized.”</p>

<p>Johnny slapped his knee emphatically. “I tell you,” he declared, “the
man what killed him tore off that band!”</p>

<p>Tony shrugged his shoulders. “<i>Quien sabe!</i>” he muttered.</p>

<p>Johnny was still for a minute. Then suddenly: “Say! That man had a horse
when he came here. He didn’t walk into town.”</p>

<p>“<i>Diga</i>, Johnny! He have beeg horse—Spanish horse.”</p>

<p>“Come on! I’m goin’ to find him. The man must have had a bed-roll or a
saddle-bag. We’ll have a look-see.”</p>

<p>The places in Standing Rock where a man might stable a horse were not so
numerous that it took Johnny and Tony any great time to find the big
stallion. He was in Ed Brackett’s barn.</p>

<p>It was Johnny’s intention to become possessed of the man’s personal
effects if any there should be. For this very excellent reason he
entered the barn without disturbing Brackett.</p>

<p>Tony immediately recognized the big horse. The stallion eyed them
nervously. A flow of liquid Spanish from the Basque reassured the horse.
Johnny searched the pegs along the wall for the missing roll. A low word
to Tony told the Basque that he had found what they came for.</p>

<p>“Come on,” came the whisper. “We’ll drift back to the hotel and look
this stuff over.”</p>

<p>In their little room in the Palace they sorted out the man’s
belongings—shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and a little bag containing a
sewing kit and odds and ends a lone man might be expected to carry.</p>

<p>“Not much here,” Johnny said slowly. “Seems like a man would carry
somethin’ personal. Anyways, it proves he didn’t hide that hat-band or
Indian luck piece. It’d be here if he had.”</p>

<p>Tony grunted in answer. Johnny picked up a shirt to stuff it back into
the leather bag. As he did so a black wallet slipped out and fell upon
the bed.</p>

<p>“There’s somet’in’,” the Basque exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Four hundred dollars! He wasn’t robbed, Tony! And here’s a picture—a
kid’s picture!”</p>

<p>Tony crowded close to look at it.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” muttered Johnny. “Thought maybe I might recognize it.
That was hopin’ for too much. But it’ll help some day. That’s a clew!
I’ll just freeze on to it.”</p>

<p>Putting the small photograph into his pocket, he proceeded to replace
the other things in the old saddlebag. Tony watched him for several
minutes. The Basque’s face showed dismay. At times he could not
understand his gringo friend. He felt ignored now. Johnny caught the
signs of distress.</p>

<p>“But, Tony, you didn’t know the kid. You was back in that dear Spain
when that little photo was snapped. <i>Muchachito</i>, you go to bed.
Tomorrow we got plenty work to do. I got a clew now.”</p>

<p>“Clew? Damn my soul, Johnny, you talk like deeteckteeve.”</p>

<p>“<i>Companero</i>, you string along with me. We’re goin’ to see the sights
before this thing’s over.”</p>

<p>Tony went to sleep; not so Johnny. He brought forth the photograph which
he had found, and sat for half an hour studying it; trying to whip his
mind into finding some likeness in it to some one he knew.</p>

<p>“That’s all I got,” he murmured. “It’s got to tell me somethin’.”</p>

<p>He placed the picture on the bed before him, and bent over it, his eyes
screwed into a squint. Minutes slipped by unnoticed. Something vaguely
reminiscent about the photograph began to torture him. Try as he would,
he could not say what it was that was playing a sort of mental hide and
go seek with him. At times he wondered if he were not the prey of his
own desires. And yet, a little voice persisted within him. There was
something here that stirred memories!</p>

<p>When it came to him, it came suddenly. His face went white.</p>

<p>“My God!” he whispered, clutching the picture. “The thing around that
kid’s neck is the locket Molly Kent wears!”</p>

<p>From staring at the picture he turned to the sleeping Tony. He even
started to arouse him, but thought better of it.</p>

<p>“No,” he said to himself. “I’ll keep this secret. This <i>is</i> a clew!”</p>

<p>He tried to argue that the child in the picture bore some resemblance to
Kent’s daughter; but he could not convince himself.</p>

<p>“This picture might be a boy’s, for all that,” he muttered. “Looks
somethin’ like the dead man, too.”</p>

<p>He gave up puzzling his brain over it, and kicking off his boots, made
ready for bed. The locket in the picture and the one Molly wore were the
same. That was enough. How she came by it, he’d try to learn tomorrow.
Maybe old Jackson had bought it for her.</p>

<p>Jackson Kent! That started a new line of thought. Johnny became wide
awake. Kent had fired him; the old man had seemed deaf to certain facts;
and now this locket of Molly’s! A broad-side struck Johnny Dice.</p>

<p>“My God!” he exclaimed loud enough to wake up his pal. “Is that why he
shut me up? Did Jackson Kent kill that man?”</p>

</h2>

<p>Johnny Dice lay abed the following morning until half past seven
o’clock, shamelessly reveling in his freedom from toil. At five Hobe and
the others, Tony included, had trooped down to breakfast. Fifteen
minutes later the Diamond-Bar boys had headed for the shipping pens to
resume where they had left off the previous evening. Tony, helpless with
nothing to do, waited with growing impatience for the appearance of the
prodigal.</p>

<p>Specters of doubt, tantalizing ghosts of indecision troubled the
sleeping Mr. Dice. His pugnacious face wore a frown. Every now and then
his mouth would straighten and his jaw would shoot out to an alarming
prominence. Maybe a dramatic gesture with his hand would follow. Johnny
seemed continually to lose the decision in this silent fighting, for he
would try it first on one side and then on the other.</p>

<p>Big Hobe had always found a bucketful of cold water a most excellent
antidote for these symptoms; but Johnny was suffering from more than
just too much sleep. He had closed his eyes convinced that he could put
his hand on the guilty man. His deductions had been honest, sensible.
Old man Kent was as guilty! Subconsciously, doubt had crept into his
mind.</p>

<p>Jackson Kent had become such a meek, painfully righteous person these
last few years that he seemed to lack the spinal stiffening a killer
must possess. If he had been accused of taking nickels out of the
collection box, one might have believed it of him; but murder? No! You’d
have to have the reason for the crime, the whole, inside story of it
before you could go out and expect men to believe you. Jackson Kent was
a rich man, a figure of some importance in Shoshone County politics.</p>

<p>“Yes, we grant all that,” whispered perverse little fiends in Johnny’s
ear, “but isn’t it men like Kent who, free from popular suspicion,
commit crimes of this sort? Wasn’t his position in the county, his very
respectability his best safeguard?”</p>

<p>Wild-eyed, Johnny sat up suddenly, his red head shaking doggedly. He
looked about the room as if searching for the little devils that had
romped through his sleep.</p>

<p>A grunt and an indulgent smile followed as he threw back the covers.
“I’m sufferin’ from that psychic stuff,” he muttered. “Or is it food I
need?”</p>

<p>His watch in his hands, he went to the door and called down to Vin:
“Hey, Vin! Give me food or give me death! I’ll be there <i>muy pronto,
muchachito</i>.”</p>

<p>Vinnie had a steaming breakfast on the table when Johnny entered the
dining room. “By Chris’, Johnny, you sleep lak’ meel-li-on-aire. How you
theenk I run theese bus’ness, breakfuss h’eight o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Aw, go on, you old dude!” Johnny laughed. “I’ll be borrowin’ money from
you before I git through.”</p>

<p>It was only talk on Johnny’s part, but the Basque chose to take it
seriously.</p>

<p>“That’s all right wit’ me, Johnny.” Vin shook his head solemnly. “I don’
refuse you, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how sweet those words, ‘I will lend you,’” Johnny said airily. “But
not yet you won’t, <i>señor</i>. Little Johnny has plenty <i>dinero</i>. Is the
old man gone?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí!</i> Hobe and heem go half past five. Leetle while ago the old man
come back alone an’ tak’ the train for Winnemucca.”</p>

<p>“Winnemucca?” Johnny Dice’s eyebrows lifted. Was Kent running away?</p>

<p>Hobe entered then to square the Diamond-Bar debt with the hotel. The
barroom was deserted, and the foreman, peeking into the dining room, saw
Johnny and Vin. He came in and settled himself in a chair opposite the
former.</p>

<p>“Go and figure up yore bill, Vinnie,” he said to the Basque. When Vin
had left, Hobe turned his inquisitive eyes to Johnny. “Last night was a
terrible bust round here, wa’n’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s all jake with me, Hobe. Don’t you fret.”</p>

<p>Ferris got up and walked back and forth a step or two, glum, his chin on
his chest. “I reckon it ain’t all right with me, though. I ain’t exactly
what you’d call a straw boss with this outfit—not after all these years.
If it wa’n’t for the girl I’d ask for my time.”</p>

<p>Hobe propped back into his chair.</p>

<p>“Reckon I couldn’t face her, though. She knows he’s slippin’.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s knife and fork came down slowly, a peculiar dryness creeping
into his throat as he thought of Molly Kent. He had forgotten her! Yet
others, Hobe for instance, found time to think of her and consider her
happiness.</p>

<p>And Johnny had been waiting only for Ferris to finish, to voice his
suspicion of the old man.</p>

<p>The thought sent a shiver through him. Whatever old Kent had done, he
was still Molly’s father. Johnny shook his head as he asked himself if
he could send her daddy down to Carson to be hanged. He’d damn himself
for a meddling fool before he’d be a party to that. Molly Kent meant too
much to the old Diamond-Bar hands. No wonder Hobe thought of her. Hadn’t
he taught her all the things a girl living on the range must
know—riding, shooting, man-sense, and all the rest of it?</p>

<p>Why, hadn’t he—Johnny Dice—broken her first pony? Hadn’t he even tried
to persuade Hobe into letting him show her how to ride that little
coffee cooler? And there had been parties, too, at the big house; a
girl’s pride in the day’s work well done; implicit faith in the
Diamond-Bar’s ability to come through in a pinch.</p>

<p>Cold sweat stood on Johnny’s brow as he asked himself if he could fail a
girl like her. His voice was husky as he spoke to Ferris.</p>

<p>“Where’s the old man?”</p>

<p>Hobe answered without looking up. “Gone to Winnemucca. Coming back to
the ranch from there.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said for a minute or two. Vin called to Hobe, then, and
Ferris pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“Might as well pay up and go back to the cars,” he said dolefully.
“We’ll be through, come noon.”</p>

<p>Johnny got to his feet with the foreman.</p>

<p>“Listen, Hobe,” he said, “did I make a fool of myself last night,
lightin’ into the old man thataway?”</p>

<p>Hobe rubbed his nose thoughtfully. “N-o-o-o,” he drawled. “One was bad
as the other. He surprised me. He’d been havin’ such a good time with
Doc all evenin’.”</p>

<p>“Huh? Doin’ what?”</p>

<p>Johnny’s face was white with an emotion that Ferris was at a loss to
understand.</p>

<p>“Playin’ pinochle. I went outside to sit down after supper. The old man
came out with me, and went across to Doc’s place. I sat out in front
till the freight pulled up. Rain drove me in. Doc and him was still at
it. I could see ’em through the window. I could tell he was winnin’.”</p>

<p>Johnny heaved a sigh of relief. That his solution of last night’s murder
was knocked flat caused no rancor in his heart. Thank God, he had not
given voice to his thoughts. Gallup would have laughed him out of town.</p>

<p>Ferris, far shrewder than he looked, had caught the signs of the anxiety
which possessed Johnny. “Say, Johnny,” he inquired, “just what is it
that y’u ain’t sayin’?”</p>

<p>Johnny winced at this directness, but he answered with a question
seemingly irrelevant to it.</p>

<p>“Did you touch that dead man last night, Hobe?”</p>

<p>Ferris cocked his head. “Of course,” he said.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t the body warm?”</p>

<p>“Sure was. The man hadn’t been dead over thirty minutes.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I figured it.”</p>

<p>If the man had been dead only half an hour and Hobe had been watching
the old man during that very time, then to a certainty Jackson Kent had
had no hand in the killing.</p>

<p>Still there was something unsaid between them. Ferris felt it. He put
his hand on Johnny’s shoulder as they started for the door. Johnny
stopped in his tracks. A flash of his eyes and the big man had his
answer.</p>

<p>“Johnny!” he gasped. “No! My God, no! The old man didn’t do that!”</p>

<p>“Did I say so?” Johnny demanded vehemently.</p>

<p>“No. But y’u were thinkin’ it. Up in the room last night it was my idea,
too. I wondered if y’d suspect him.”</p>

<p>Johnny could afford to be belligerent now.</p>

<p>“You bet I did. I suspect every man in this town until I prove to myself
that he’s innocent. That it wasn’t him, is all right with me. I couldn’t
have gone after Molly Kent’s dad. There ain’t no one else in this town
with any strings on him as far as I’m concerned. I’ll git the man.”</p>

<p>Hobe knew this was not mere talk.</p>

<p>“What are y’u goin’ to do now?”</p>

<p>“Git busy! Like as not I’ll drift out to the ranch some time today and
git my stuff. My address is where I hang my hat until I’ve put this
puzzle together.”</p>

<p>Calling the waiting Tony, the two men went down the street.</p>

<p>“You forget anythin’ I said last night, Tony,” Johnny advised the
Basque. “It’s out—complete. Git that!”</p>

<p>The direction in which they were going made Tony ask their destination.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to have a talk with Brackett. Let me do the palaverin’.”</p>

<p>The liveryman had not yet seen the corpse, so Johnny’s statement that
the big stallion belonged to the dead man was a surprise to Brackett.</p>

<p>“Do you mind, Ed, if I have a look at the horse?” Johnny asked.</p>

<p>“No harm in that,” Brackett answered. “Nobody know his name, you say?”</p>

<p>“Total stranger, Ed. There might be some mark or somethin’ on his
stuff.”</p>

<p>This brief minute of importance appealed to Ed, and the three men began
searching for some mark of identification. The missing saddlebag escaped
Brackett’s attention.</p>

<p>The search was a barren one, bed-roll, saddle and slicker being without
any tell-tale mark. The stallion’s brand, a circle-dagger, had been
over-burned years ago.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he have nothin’ up to the hotel with him?” Ed asked. “Man would
have an extra shirt and socks.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t a thing up there, Ed,” Johnny said truthfully. “Guess we can
give up lookin’ here.”</p>

<p>When they had left the stable Johnny asked the Basque:</p>

<p>“Did you git what I found?”</p>

<p>“No. Me, I get not’ing.”</p>

<p>Johnny smiled.</p>

<p>“The silver buttons on the bridle,” he explained. “Both of them marked
alike—C. T. I never heard of no brand like that. It’s his initials.
That’s somethin’ else to keep under your hat. That’s a real clew.”</p>

<p>“How you know, pleece, those t’ing ees clew?”</p>

<p>“Know? You don’t have to know. A clew is just a clew. All we’ve got to
do is to keep on gittin’ them. We’re goin’ to saddle up and fan it out
to the ranch and git our stuff. I’m through lookin’ for evidence round
here. If you saw that man on the North Fork three days ago, I just about
know the way he took into town. He must have got on the North Fork from
the west. If he did, he came through Winnemucca. Ain’t no other way he
could have got out of the hills. I’m goin’ down to old Winnemuc and
prospect around.”</p>

<p>“<i>Cuidado!</i>” Tony whispered. “Here comes Gallup.”</p>

<p>They were almost in front of Aaron’s house before they came abreast of
him. The coroner’s eyes were snapping. Even his mustache seemed to stand
at attention, bristling as it were with anger.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you little boys have been havin’ your fun this
mornin’.” He snickered contemptuously. “You take a word of advice from
me, Johnny Dice—a fool and his money soon depart!”</p>

<p>“Say, Aaron, that’s not bad. Not bad at all, but you paste this in your
hat, and let it stick to your rickety old slats—I go, oh, yes, but only
to return. In other words, I’ll be back! And somebody’s goin’ to burn
the <i>frijoles</i> when I do.” Johnny’s voice became velvety as he added:
“And there ain’t no one in this little old town makin’ me go, either,
<i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“No?” Gallup inquired with sarcastic politeness. “Don’t you be too sure
about that.”</p>

<p>Tony motioned to Johnny to come along, but the boy pushed him aside.
“Suppose you enlighten me on that last remark,” he said to Gallup.</p>

<p>Aaron did not dodge the issue. “With pleasure! You git out of town by
noon or there’ll be a warrant out for your arrest for disturbin’ the
peace. You can’t make a fool out of me and git away with it.”</p>

<p>Tony’s jaw set at the word arrest. Johnny met the threat with a smile,
but he did not take Gallup’s words as easily as he appeared to take
them.</p>

<p>“You can’t shut me up any other way,” he explained for the coroner’s
benefit, “so you’re goin’ to have Roddy throw me in jail, eh? You
politicians certainly stick together, don’t you? I’d like to see that
scarecrow sheriff go up against a real man.”</p>

<p>“If you flatter yourself that you’re one, you hang around.”</p>

<p>It was on Johnny’s tongue to make a fitting retort, to dare Gallup to
bring up his reserves, but wisdom of a sort checked the hot words. He
had set himself to do a certain thing. Shooting it out with Jasper Roddy
would not accomplish it.</p>

<p>Tony’s eyes were smiling now—a smile as guileful as his race was old.
That Basque smile under fire is one of the little ways by which the
children of the far Pyrenees announce that they are not Mexican. That
smile is something to consider if you are involved personally. Johnny
caught it and understood.</p>

<p>Gallup was waiting for an answer. Johnny found one of little truth, but
it caught old Aaron.</p>

<p>“Other business, my dear Mr. Gallup, forbids my doin’ battle with you
and yours today. But some other day, dear sir!” Johnny’s tone was too
extravagantly polite. “That little gun-play last evenin’ still absorbs
my attention, Aaron. I could almost tell you who killed that man.”</p>

<p>The seriousness with which Johnny stated this fooled even Tony.</p>

<p>Gallup’s eyes wavered ever so little as Johnny stared into them. “Let’s
hear his name,” Aaron demanded uneasily.</p>

<p>“You ask that—you of all men?” Johnny exclaimed, piling on the coals now
that he had Aaron on edge.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I ask?” the coroner almost roared. “Are you hintin’ at
somethin’?”</p>

<p>Thus did Aaron deliver himself temporarily into Johnny’s hands.</p>

<p>“Why, ain’t you the party what proclaimed long and loud last night that
that dead man killed hisself?”</p>

<p>Gallup swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“That’s all, huh?” he cried angrily. “Sounded to me like you was puttin’
me under suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I?” demanded Johnny. “I aim to, if I haven’t. I suspect every man
in this town today. And in your case, I couldn’t begin to tell you all
that I suspect about you.”</p>

<p>“Mouth talk—sluff, that’s all anybody can git from you!” Gallup shook
his fist in Johnny’s face. “When I talk, I say somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, your tongue’s all right, Aaron, but your brain is dead. You go
down to Brackett’s place and find out a thing or two. That dead man’s
horse and outfit is down there.”</p>

<p>Tony’s smile melted to one of almost positive enjoyment as he saw
Gallup’s dismay. This bit of information thoroughly upset Aaron. Truly,
this Dice person had put one over on him!</p>

<p>“You meddlin’ insect!” Gallup screeched as he stamped away. “You’ve got
two hours to git out of town. You’ll find I know eighteen or twenty
little ways to shut you up!”</p>

<p>Johnny sped him on his way with a laugh that curdled the old man’s soul.</p>

<p>At the corner, Johnny stopped to gaze at Aaron’s retreating figure, now
a block away. Turning into the crossroad, they waited until Gallup
entered Brackett’s barn.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tony,” Johnny urged. “I’ve got a strange desire to see the
inside of Mr. Gallup’s house. You stay in front. I’m goin’ through the
window. Move up and down. Whistle if he comes back.”</p>

<p>Johnny did not wait for the Basque to caution him. The window was open,
and without any effort Johnny hoisted himself over the sill. Five
minutes later he was back, and with Tony, started for the Palace.</p>

<p>Once in their room, Johnny pulled out the dead man’s gun. “We’re outside
the law now, all right,” he muttered. “But we got the reason for goin’
to Winnemuc!”</p>

<p>“Those gun?”</p>

<p>“Sure, those gun,” Johnny laughed. “That’s a brand new firin’ pin in
that pistol. I’m going to find out who put it there. They ain’t no
gunsmith this side of Winnemucca. Roll your stuff and we’ll drift.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were ready.</p>

<p>“Mebbe you suppose Gallup fin’ those bridle buttons?” Tony asked as they
started down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Not a chance, <i>muchachito</i>.” Johnny patted his pants pocket. “I don’t
leave nothin’ behind.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>IF THIS BE LOVE</span>
</h2>

<p>Shortly after five o’clock that same day, Johnny and Tony emerged from
the lava beds to the east of the Diamond-Bar stronghold. Below them, its
fringe of poplars glistening in the sunlight, stood the comfortable old
house and its outbuildings.</p>

<p>The trail from town led across miles of uninteresting flats, alkali
patches and finally by means of much tortuous winding through the lava
beds. A haze, as of smoke, hung in the sky. The air was warm. At midday
it had been hot in the open. Sage hen and mountain quail rose before
them, the old cocks and hens so heavy that the frantic flapping of their
wings as they got into the air made the horses throw up their heads
every time they flushed a covey.</p>

<p>Sleeping in a saddle is a little trick the rangeman soon acquires. Many
times on this same trail Johnny and the Basque had ridden with closed
eyes, their minds in dreamland. Not so today! And wherever men toiled
north of the Humboldt this exception held true. This day was one of the
awaited ones—one of those few, brief days of Indian summer when the
desert smiles and relents. Perhaps because the time is so short, God
pours the wine of life with a lavish hand. Mexican <i>peon</i>, Basque
<i>pellado</i>, argonaut, prospector, cowman, herder—not one but answers to
the spell of this magic which the red gods long ago gave to the tribes.</p>

<p>And yet this marvelous day found a peculiar sadness in Johnny’s heart.
Restless, untalkative, he had ridden the long miles, little
understanding the misery which was in him. The sight of the old
Diamond-Bar house seemed to furnish him with an answer, for he squinted
his eyes to blot out some sudden emotion. Was he homesick? Was it the
knowledge that he would not be riding this trail again that was setting
so heavily upon him?</p>

<p>Johnny need not have wondered longer. He had discovered the truth. And
this day of days had only accentuated his unhappiness.</p>

<p>This was <i>his</i> country. He knew every mesa, draw and coulee as a city
boy knows his own block. Far horizons, towering peaks—they were
landmarks to him; things of life, with personalities. There were things
here that he loved because they were beautiful—colors unequaled, vistas
beyond comparison.</p>

<p>To say that he ever referred to it in these or similar terms would be
more than the truth. But he felt it; answered to the tug of it. And
Johnny Dice was not an emotional person.</p>

<p>And yet men called his chosen land a desert. Passing strange it is that
so ill a name suffices.</p>

<p>When they reached the house they found it seemingly as lazy as the day.
Charlie Sam, the Chinese cook, lay sprawled upon a bench in the sun. He
did not so much as move as Johnny rode past him. Little Hughie High, who
combined the duties of ranch blacksmith, filer, and man of all work, had
been tinkering with the windmill. He waved a careless hand from his
perch above them, but made no word of greeting, fearing to break the
undisturbed comfort which so rarely came his way.</p>

<p>A wide hall led through the ranch-house, in back of which stood the
bunk-house. Beyond that, at some distance, were the barns and corrals.
On the side of the house facing the men’s quarters, with a door opening
to the hallway, the old man had his office, a big square-shaped room.</p>

<p>On stated occasions, when it pleased old Jackson to unbend, he escorted
whichever of his men he had invited into his sanctum, down that long,
wide hall to the front door. Only at such times did the Diamond-Bar
hands tread those precincts.</p>

<p>Tony went on to the bunk-house, but Johnny stopped and whistled a call.
It went unanswered. His roving eyes searched the yard and windows, but
Molly Kent was not to be seen. Walking around to the front of the house,
Johnny peered through open doors. Tony had gone around to the rear of
the place by now, and Johnny saw him as he stepped into the bunk-house.</p>

<p>Left alone with his thoughts, the boy stopped and listened. Only the
penetrating sound of Charlie Sam’s snoring broke the stillness.
Cautiously, Johnny whistled again. His embarrassment grew as he waited.
Minutes passed, and a boldness he had never known in his days as a
Diamond-Bar man took possession of him. Crossing the threshold he tapped
on the door of Molly Kent’s room.</p>

<p>Light as his tap had been the unlatched door moved back an inch or two.
The delicate perfume which he had always associated with Molly reached
his nostrils. Unknown to himself, he trembled.</p>

<p>She was not here; his good-bye would have to go unsaid. He extracted
some slight degree of comfort from that. Good-byes did not come easily
to his lips.</p>

<p>An overwhelming desire to push back that door and to stand for just one
minute in the room which she had sanctified with her presence all these
years took possession of him. There in her room he’d say his farewell to
her.</p>

<p>From his pocket he brought forth a mysterious little package—a mouth
organ. This was in answer to Molly’s often expressed desire for one.
Johnny had not spared his money in purchasing it. He had had it sent all
the way from San Francisco. He looked at the package as if asking it to
answer him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he murmured; “this’ll be best. I’ll just leave it on her dresser
for her. Maybe she’ll guess it’s from me.”</p>

<p>The inside of that room was a revelation to Johnny Dice. Never before
had he been face to face with feminine daintiness of this sort. From the
chintz curtains and colorful cretonnes to the array of mysterious
articles spread about him this room was as different from the rest of
the house as day is from night.</p>

<p>Something sang in Johnny’s heart as he reached out to place his gift on
Molly’s dresser and found himself gazing at his own picture in a neat
little frame hung to one side of the girl’s large mirror.</p>

<p>The picture was an old-fashioned studio photograph portraying the
subject in one of his saddest and most miserable moments. Johnny’s pride
had long since forced him to destroy the copy he had kept for himself.
But there it was in her room!</p>

<p>The world suddenly became a paradise. Even on Johnny the day had not
been wasted. He smiled sheepishly on catching sight of his own
reflection in the glass. He began to ask himself important questions.
Between Molly and him there had never passed a word beyond the province
of friendship. She was a rich man’s daughter, and forty a month is no
inducement to hold out to young ladies of her means. And then, too, it
didn’t lead to steady employment if one made eyes at owners’ daughters.
There were some social barriers even in Nevada.</p>

<p>Now, that he was leaving, matters matured very rapidly in the boy’s
mind. What sort of a fool had he been all these years not to have known
that he was over his head, that Molly Kent meant more to him than any
other being who had come into his life? An hour ago he had told himself
he was blue because he was leaving the country and the Diamond-Bar
behind. That was a lie! Own up to it, now. It wasn’t the Diamond-Bar or
the purple shadows on the Tuscaroras that he was going to miss. No! It
was Molly Kent!</p>

<p>And Molly? Johnny’s teeth clenched under his tightly pressed lips as he
gazed once more on that picture of himself.</p>

<p>“She don’t hate me, at least,” he murmured half aloud. “Who’d ever
thought she’d ’a’ kept that thing all these years? Why—and there’s those
little silver spurs I brung her when she was just a kid. Real silver,
they was, too.”</p>

<p>Johnny put his hand on them tenderly. He seemed to have difficulty in
breathing. Emotion was welling up in him to a point which made him reel.
The mouth organ was placed on the bureau. He wanted to get outside, to
think, to tell himself that he had not been dreaming, that life still
went on.</p>

<p>Was it because of Molly that the old man had been so short with him? The
thought galloped through Johnny’s mind. Did Jackson Kent see in him a
possible suitor for her hand—an undesirable, financially irresponsible
suitor? Had there been talk, whisperings behind his back? Had Molly said
anything? A dozen questions leaped to his mind. He shook his head
wearily as he turned for the door, anxious to be away from this house
which only a few minutes before he had been loath to leave. Another step
would have taken him to the door, when he stopped, mouth open, his eyes
bulging as if they could not believe what they beheld. Slowly the foot
which he had poised in mid-air came down; but the accusing finger which
he had pointed at the thing beside the door did not waver.</p>

<p>“Great God!” he groaned. “That’s a copy of the picture I’ve got in my
pocket!”</p>

<p>It was, beyond question. Set in a small gold frame hung beside the door
was an exact duplicate of the photograph he had found in the dead man’s
wallet.</p>

<p>With cold fingers he held up the picture that he drew from his pocket
until it rested beside the one on the wall. They were the same!</p>

<p>Eyes transfixed, Johnny stared on and on, and as he stood there
spellbound, the door opened. Jackson Kent faced him. Something too big
for words held the two for a brief second. Johnny was the first to
react. Surreptitiously the hand holding the picture moved to his pocket,
but he was too late. The old man had been staring at it.</p>

<p>Fingers of steel caught and held Johnny’s arm. The surprise had died out
of Kent’s eyes. They were flashing now with a madman’s fury. The boy
could feel the man’s hot breath upon his cheek. Johnny heard the other’s
voice break as he fought for speech.</p>

<p>Then, with heaving lungs, old Jackson cried out:</p>

<p>“Give it to me! Give it to me—do you hear?” His voice arose until it
became almost a scream as he demanded: “What are <i>you</i> doin’ with <i>that</i>
picture of my little girl?”</p>

<p>Kent’s hungry fingers lunged for the coveted photograph. Johnny’s eyes
had narrowed to mere slits.</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed. “I keep that picture. It belongs to a dead man!”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chVIII' title='VIII: STRAIGHT TALK'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>STRAIGHT TALK</span>
</h2>

<p>Johnny had immediate cause to regret his melodramatic words.</p>

<p>“Give me his name! Tell me who he was!” the old man shouted.</p>

<p>And obviously Johnny could not answer truthfully. He pondered lie after
lie without finding one to pass muster. Kent saw his helplessness.</p>

<p>“You can’t answer, eh? Well, maybe you can tell me what you’re doin’
here in this room.”</p>

<p>“Tony and I came to git our stuff,” Johnny replied.</p>

<p>“Your stuff? It ain’t in here, is it?”</p>

<p>“I had a little present for Miss Molly. I wanted to leave it where she’d
git it. I reckoned I’d not be seein’ her again, soon.”</p>

<p>“Present?” Old Jackson’s lips curled contemptuously. “I’ll bring all the
presents she needs. You been treated most like one of the family round
here, so you show your gratitude by shinin’ up to my girl, eh?”</p>

<p>“You know that ain’t so,” Johnny answered miserably. “Hobe and me has
been bringin’ her little things nigh ten years.”</p>

<p>“She was a child then. And you carryin’ her picture around. I won’t have
it! Damn it, I won’t! My girl ain’t intended for no forty-dollar-a-month
cowpunch. I want that picture.”</p>

<p>Johnny shook his head. Less angry than he had been, he said:</p>

<p>“I can’t give it to you. If Molly says she wants it, all right. I’ll
give it to her. Ain’t no talk goin’ to make me change my mind about
that.”</p>

<p>“She’ll tell you quick enough.” Kent raised his voice to cry out her
name.</p>

<p>“No good doin’ that,” Johnny advised. “She ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out whether she is or not. You git your stuff now. Take your
presents with you, too.”</p>

<p>Johnny had never been dismissed in this fashion. Tight-lipped, cheeks
burning, he shook his head. “No,” he muttered, “I’d not do that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take care of it, then.”</p>

<p>And he caught up the harmonica and hurled it through the open window.
“You git your stuff,” he thundered.</p>

<p>The lust to tear this old man’s body with his hands surged in Johnny
Dice. And yet, Molly was his daughter! The thought struck Johnny with a
double significance. Jackson Kent had identified the dead man’s
treasured keepsake. But why had that man carried Molly Kent’s
photograph? Questions began stabbing at Johnny’s brain.</p>

<p>Molly had had nothing to do with the man’s death. Hobe had given the old
man an alibi. But there was a draw to this affair which could not be
argued into nothingness. Molly was mysteriously away from home; Jackson
here when he had left for Winnemucca, and always that picture of the
girl in the dead man’s wallet to be explained.</p>

<p>In a sort of daze Johnny got his blankets and other gear and placed them
upon his saddle.</p>

<p>Kent had roused Charlie Sam and set him to ringing the ranch-house bell.
Only little Hughie answered the bell’s imperative summons.</p>

<p>“Where’s Molly?” the girl’s father demanded.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s a hard question to answer,” Hughie replied. “Never a word
did she say to me. She got her horse herself this mornin’. ’Twa’n’t
later than eight when she rode off. Charlie, here, must have talked to
her.”</p>

<p>“No talk,” squint-eyed Charlie Sam declared. “Me pack lunch. She damn
big hurry.”</p>

<p>“One of you must have seen whicha-way she went.”</p>

<p>“Left here headin’ for Argenta,” Hughie exclaimed. “I was over there
last night for the mail. Brought a letter for her. Mayhap she’s ridden
out with the answer.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t been in Argenta,” Kent said positively. “I—got off there
myself, and borrowed a horse from Matt Pease. I’d ’a’ passed her on the
road if she’d been headin’ there.”</p>

<p>Argenta is a flag station half-way between Standing Rock and Winnemucca.
The old man could easily enough have done as he claimed. But where could
Molly have gone? If she had gone south, she must have come to the
railroad. Surely she would not have bothered with lunch had she set out
for Argenta or any neighboring ranch.</p>

<p>Beyond question she had not gone to Standing Rock or else Johnny and
Tony would have passed her. That left only Winnemucca as a possible
destination. Hughie’s observation that she had been “all dressed up”
only added to Johnny’s conviction that he would find her there. But why
had she left without leaving a note for her father? And why the long
ride when she might have caught a train at Argenta or Standing Rock?
Wasn’t it plain that she hoped to go unquestioned? But what had she to
conceal? Could the letter which Hughie had brought be the answer?</p>

<p>Johnny glanced at the old man, who was pacing back and forth, mumbling
to himself. His concern for his girl swept away some of the boy’s angry
feelings. Old tyrant that he was, no one could deny his love for Molly.</p>

<p>“She shouldn’t do these fool things,” Johnny heard him say. “Runnin’ off
without a word! She’s only a girl; only a child.” He stopped to catch
Johnny’s eye. “You come in here a minute,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Tony sighed impatiently as Johnny and the old man went inside.</p>

<p>When the two men reached the office Kent shot his demand at the boy
without a second’s delay:</p>

<p>“I want that picture!”</p>

<p>“I told you I’d give it to Molly if she won’t let me keep it. That’s my
answer. I never knew till an hour ago what she meant to me. I’m tellin’
you fair, now, that I’m takin’ my orders from her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re armed, and so is the Basque, but I’ll have my say before
very long. You stay ’way from my daughter. You’re a fool if you’re
countin’ on puttin’ her between us. She’s my girl! Keep your picture!
She’ll be askin’ for it quick enough. Don’t let me hear that you’re
showin’ it round, makin’ talk. By God, there won’t be room enough in
this State for you if you do.”</p>

<p>“Your opinion of me does credit to you, don’t it?” the boy snapped back.
“Funny you didn’t find me out long ago.”</p>

<p>“You keep your back talk,” Kent roared. “Where you goin’ when you leave
here?”</p>

<p>Johnny smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>“That’s a fair question. I’ll ask you one, and we’ll be even-Stephen.
When you left Standing Rock this mornin’ you told Hobe you were off for
Winnemuc. I’d admire to know what made you change your mind.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” gasped the old man. “My comin’s and goin’s are my
own business. Are you hintin’ at somethin’?</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t hintin’. But I’m doin’ some tall thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“You can give it a name if you’re half a man.”</p>

<p>Johnny turned away sadly.</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t measure up,” he said slowly. “And, besides, I’d hate to
give tongue to it. But I’ll say this much”—and he wheeled on old Kent
again—“I’ll answer your first question. I’m goin’ and goin’ when I leave
here. And I’m goin’ to keep on movin’ till I find out who killed that
man in Standing Rock. Till I do, my address is in my hat. I know you’ve
got the low-down on me. Well, let it ride. No matter what you think, I
shoot square. You’re rich, you’ve got big friends; I know what you can
do to me. Hop to it! But don’t you ever forgit that while I live I love
your daughter. And if I ever amount to anythin’, and she’ll have me,
I’ll come back and marry her. And you can please go to hell!”</p>

</h2>

<p>The following morning at eleven o’clock Johnny and Tony sent their tired
ponies across the newfangled concrete bridge which spanned the Humboldt
on upper Bridge Street.</p>

<p>Winnemucca lay somnolent in the midday sun, the street so deep with dust
that it softened the sound of their horses’ hoofs to a dull pad-pad as
they continued on past Rinehart’s general store and the new State Bank
building. The two men had ridden all night. In fact, they had put a
staggering number of miles behind them since they had left Standing Rock
the preceding day.</p>

<p>Johnny swung off his horse in front of the Eldorado Hotel. He had long
since decided that he would find Molly registered there. His method of
ascertaining this was indeed strange, for, instead of going to the desk
where the register lay open to public view, he made directly for the
bar. Whitey Carr, the bartender, nodded to him. Johnny said “How?” and
ordered a drink. It was to win this bit of recognition that he had
entered the room. He had been there often enough to have more than a
nodding acquaintance with Whitey and his co-workers. In truth, Johnny’s
intimacy with the craft was well-nigh universal.</p>

<p>Being remembered, and thusly armed for his attack on the register, he
searched for some written sign of the girl’s presence. Her name did not
reward him. Whitey Carr saw his perturbance and through the swinging
doors he called:</p>

<p>“Who you looking for, Johnny?”</p>

<p>Johnny’s desire to find the girl outweighed his desire for secrecy.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for the old man’s daughter,” he called back to Whitey.</p>

<p>The bartender shook his head positively.</p>

<p>“Ain’t been no females here in two days,” he said. “That is, exceptin’
some show folks.”</p>

<p>There was no need looking for her at the other hotels. If she were in
town she would be here. Johnny’s face wore a frown as he stepped to the
door and motioned to Tony to come in and eat.</p>

<p>“She ain’t here,” he said to the Basque. “We got to eat, though. Soon as
I get a few victuals inside of me I’ll prospect around.”</p>

<p>The restaurant was a long, narrow room set with high stools before a
wooden counter. Tony tried to make talk, but the boy was more intent on
watching the few passers-by on Bridge Street, hoping against hope that
he might catch a glimpse of the girl. But he finished his meal of ham
and eggs and pie without this coming to pass.</p>

<p>When he had paid their check he said to Tony:</p>

<p>“You’d better git a room and turn in for an hour or two. I’ll be back
soon. What we got to do won’t be done in a day.”</p>

<p>“For why you leave me behin’, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t leavin’ you behind. I tell you, we need sleep. We may be
headin’ back for Standing Rock tonight. You turn in.”</p>

<p>Leaving the hotel, Johnny went down the street to Dan Secor’s shop. Old
Dan ran a second-hand store and pawnshop in addition to his business of
gunsmithing. He was going home for dinner when Johnny hailed him.</p>

<p>“Hey, Dan,” the boy called, “I want to see you a minute before you go.
Open up for a second.”</p>

<p>“That’s you boys,” the old fellow growled. “Sit here all mornin’ long
’thout nary a customer, and soon as I gits locked up you flock in. What
you want?”</p>

<p>“Dan, I want you to take a look at this gun. D’you ever see it before?”</p>

<p>Dan had to put his specs in position before he could answer.</p>

<p>“Sure; put that firin’ pin in myself. That’s an old Ross pistol.”</p>

<p>Johnny was all smiles.</p>

<p>This was the first bit of luck to come his way this day.</p>

<p>“I reckoned you’d fixed it up.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t yore gun, is it?” old Dan questioned. “Leastways, it wa’n’t you
had it in here to be fixed.”</p>

<p>“No. I just came by the gun accidental-like. I’m right interested in the
man what owned it, though. Suppose you got his name in your books.”</p>

<p>“Umph—umph!” Dan grunted. “Ain’t, neither. I ’member he waited here
while I put in the pin. Had quite a talk.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s face fell. Old Dan’s words had dropped him from the clouds to
the bottomless pit. What mattered it that he had traced the dead man’s
movements to Secor’s shop? His surmising was proved correct, but the
murdered man’s identity remained a mystery, and that had to be solved
before he could proceed with any assurance of success. Johnny cursed in
his chagrin. Could you find two men in a hundred who would have a gun
repaired while they waited? Of course not! It was just a trick of fate’s
to thwart him. It wouldn’t happen so again in a thousand years.</p>

<p>“You seem right put out,” Dan rejoined. “Man ain’t done nothin’?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. Say, you mind tellin’ me what you two talked about?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know as I do. Wa’n’t nothin’ puss’nal; ’twas mostly cattle talk,
him askin’ after the brands folks was runnin’ along the river. You know,
light talk—two old men.”</p>

<p>The old gunsmith took off his glasses and gazed vacantly into space, as
if beholding some pleasant vista of almost forgotten years. “Yes,” he
murmured, “two old men. Him and me had been in Santa Fe ’bout the same
time.” Dan clucked his lips at the memory. “Them was the days; riotin’
ever’ night, hell poppin’ over in the Tonto, Injuns puttin’ on the paint
every now and then.”</p>

<p>The old man paused abruptly. Then:</p>

<p>“Say, Johnny!” he exclaimed. “Come to think on it, your man did say
somethin’ puss’nal. Asked me what folks said of old Kent’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Johnny’s exclamation was whipped out with such force as to startle old
Dan. Here was that draw again—Molly and the dead man. Every place he
turned he came face to face with it.</p>

<p>The gunsmith misunderstood the boy’s attitude. “Why, Johnny, they wa’n’t
no harm in the question. I told him folks said only good things of Molly
Kent. And he didn’t seem to set no great store by my answer. Said he was
goin’ over to the Piute Reservation; didn’t say he was, but I knew it
because he asked me if he could git to Standing Rock from the North Fork
without a-comin’ way back here.”</p>

<p>Johnny began to understand that the talk the two men had was of vital
importance, even though old Dan saw nothing of value in it. The boy
wondered if he should tell the old man of the murder. Another day and he
would know of it, anyhow. Better make an ally of the old man and get him
to hold his tongue. And then, too, the surprise of telling him now might
startle him into recalling some other bit of conversation.</p>

<p>“Dan,” he began, “when did you have that talk?”</p>

<p>“’Bout six days ago, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t sure?”</p>

<p>“Le’s see—yes, I’m sot on that. ’Twas the first of the month.”</p>

<p>The first of the month; this was the sixth. Tony had seen the man on the
North Fork five days ago. It fitted in!</p>

<p>“He didn’t say who he was goin’ to see over in the Injun country?”</p>

<p>“Don’t reckon he did.”</p>

<p>“That’s goin’ to be awfully important, Dan, because this man got hisself
killed night before last.”</p>

<p>“No! Not killed?”</p>

<p>“Killed dead. Old Aaron says he killed hisself. It’s a lie. He was
murdered. I’m aimin’ to find out who did it. And, Dan, when folks git to
talkin’ about it down here, I want you to be dumb. That man got a rotten
deal. Ain’t nobody but me goin’ to square it. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say yes. You ain’t askin’ me nothin’.” He shook his head. “Killed,
eh? And him lookin’ to be so handy with a gun. It wa’n’t no fair fight.”</p>

<p>“You said somethin’. I know he was on the North Fork. Went to the Rock
from there. But there was two days in between. Do you suppose he was on
the Reservation all that time? Can’t you remember who he was goin’ to
see over there? Was it Ames, the trader, or the agent? Maybe it was old
Thunder Bird!”</p>

<p>“No, Johnny, he didn’t say. But he did tell me he was comin’ back! Said
he’d be here Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Saturday? That’s today.” Johnny whistled a surprised note or two. Dan
watched him as he walked back and forth, hands thrust deep into his
pockets. “Saturday,” the boy muttered. “Comin’ back here. Say, Dan, what
would he be comin’ back here for? Was he aimin’ to meet somebody?”</p>

<p>“That might ’a’ been it. Or mail—he might ’a’ been expectin’ a letter.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” Johnny pounded the counter vehemently. “He was comin’ back
for his mail!”</p>

<p>Johnny was so excited that the noon-time pedestrians stared at him as
they passed.</p>

<p>The boy was unmindful of them until a girl’s mocking laugh reached his
ears. He turned, then, to stare her down; but the expression on his face
changed with magic swiftness, for, standing there watching him, her face
pressed close to old Dan’s window, was Molly Kent.</p>

<p>She had been watching him these many seconds. A roguish light swam in
her eyes as Johnny’s mouth sagged with amazement.</p>

<p>“Ride him, cowboy!” she called. “Ride him!”</p>

<p>It was the old Diamond-Bar battle-cry.</p>

<p>Johnny shook his head dully. “I’m damned!” was all he could say.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>MOLLY KENT</span>
</h2>

<p>Sweet Molly Kent was as a flower blooming in the grayness of wind-swept
Winnemucca. Johnny wondered how she contrived to be so clean and
pressed. He had been to San Francisco and seen the fashionable folk of
Grant Avenue. Molly could have walked among them this day to their envy.</p>

<p>On the range she wore fitting clothes, but never—Heaven forbid!—the
side-show “cow-girl” costume which Western girls are popularly supposed
to wear. Brown tweeds of a sensible cut, and boots to match the best,
served her. If she made any concession to the popular idea it was in the
wearing of a small sombrero. Johnny had seen her so attired times enough
to have overcome his awe of her. This new dress of today, however, was
thoroughly disconcerting. Wise Molly divined his embarrassment and,
womanlike, enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The flash of her gleaming white teeth only added to the boy’s
uneasiness. It was so much better to observe girls of her type from a
distance. Not that she was merely pretty or in a true sense beautiful.
Molly’s chin was too masculine for that, her eyes too wide-set. And yet
it was her eyes and that very chin which compelled attention. There was
sense in this girl, a clean body and a clean mind. Loyalty spoke, too.</p>

<p>Others had noted these things. Men do. Yes, and most women, too. Springy
step, well-rounded ankles, glorious body, the touch of color in the
cheeks glowing against her black hair—they all spoke of youth, of rare
vitality. Here was a human being come thus far from the Master’s mold
unmarred. And this in a rough country. It was no mean compliment to
Jackson Kent.</p>

<p>Poor Johnny! He sensed these things and felt himself ugly, awkward,
hopeless before her. At this moment he would have fought any man so rash
as to claim that she could ever care for his unworthy self.</p>

<p>Taking pity on Johnny, Molly ended his misery by breaking the spell
which held him.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to strike that old man,” she said half
seriously. “I’d like to know what you are doing down here.”</p>

<p>“Business,” Johnny answered dryly.</p>

<p>“Well, the Diamond-Bar is shipping from Standing Rock, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Molly’s eyes held his provokingly.</p>

<p>“It is,” Johnny drawled nervously.</p>

<p>“But you’re not. Is that what you are trying to say, Mr. Dice?”</p>

<p>Johnny nodded his head ever so slightly. The smile left Molly’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Father and you again, Johnny?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Just me this time, I guess. No matter. I got my pay. But let’s talk of
somethin’ pleasant, if there is any such.”</p>

<p>The girl’s gayety did not return so easily. “I just can’t be pleasant by
request, that way, Johnny,” she said honestly. “I want to talk to you
about this before I start for home.”</p>

<p>“When you leavin’ here?”</p>

<p>“Not before morning.”</p>

<p>This suited Mr. Dice.</p>

<p>“You rode in, didn’t yuh?” he questioned. Molly grinned in spite of
herself. “Folks to home all worried about you,” the boy went on. “Your
daddy tearin’ hair and cursin’. I figured you was down here, and I
looked for you at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell me what you thought when you found I wasn’t there. Of
course I wouldn’t go to a hotel. The Langwell girls would never forgive
me if I did. Don’t tell me <i>you</i> were worried.”</p>

<p>“That would be kinda hard for me, wouldn’t it?” Johnny drawled.</p>

<p>Molly laughed outright at this. “Next to injured feelings, there’s
nothing like self-pity to make a person miserable, is there, Johnny? Now
you tell me, is father out looking for me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly is. You’d better send a telegram over to Argenta. Hughie High
will be down there tonight for the mail.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I don’t understand what brought father back from the Rock so
quickly. Was it anything to do with you?”</p>

<p>And now Johnny lied. “I’d hate to think so,” he told her.</p>

<p>Shrewd Molly was not more than half convinced of this.</p>

<p>“And the business that brought you here?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Apparently, a violent itching of the Dice scalp followed, but the girl
insisted upon an answer.</p>

<p>“Er—private business,” Johnny said lamely; but to Molly it carried an
air of mystery.</p>

<p>“Well, you meet me at the hotel about two. I wish father had stayed at
the Rock another day.”</p>

<p>Johnny turned back to Dan’s place, but the old man had slipped out. So,
left to himself, the boy promptly began to worry over Molly’s farewell
words. It was plain enough that she had hoped to make her hurried trip
without her father knowing of it. But what reason could she have for
that? The question stayed with Mr. Dice. The girl was nervous. He could
tell that. Coming to Winnemucca had always been something of a lark.
Well, he had failed to find any spirit of vacation about her today. A
blunt question or two would follow this afternoon!</p>

<p>Johnny had voiced his need of sleep, but now that he had the opportunity
he made no effort to resign himself to it. For one thing, he wanted to
think over that trip to the reservation. Western men did not go romping
over the hills to Indian country for the thrill of going. It had been
one of the dead man’s last acts; perhaps the one which had led to his
death.</p>

<p>The boy could advance a dozen reasons for the man’s going there.
Instinctively he felt it held the answer to the riddle he was trying to
solve. Another talk with Dan was urgent, and then a visit to the Agency.
Johnny could talk the Piute hand language. If necessary he would stay
there for days until he had talked to every brave on the reservation.</p>

<p>But that was something for this afternoon or tomorrow. For the immediate
present he had a matter of equal importance in mind. Perhaps nothing
would come of it, but it was surely worth the effort. Johnny was as
certain now as he had been when Molly had interrupted him in his talk
with Dan that the stranger had been coming back to Winnemucca for his
mail. It was the boy’s intention to verify this at once.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>MORE THAN A BET</span>
</h2>

<p>Noontime was an hour of leisure at the post office, due to the fact that
without exception the east and west mail trains arrived in the very
early morning or late afternoon. This suited Johnny. Strolling up to the
window he found Miss Nannie Price, the assistant postmistress, in the
act of artistically dissecting an orange.</p>

<p>“Mr. Allerdyce!” Nannie gurgled. “You <i>are</i> a stranger, even though
handsomer than usual.”</p>

<p>“Now, you stop, Miss Nannie, ma’am,” Johnny grinned. “A new neckpiece
ain’t deceivin’ you thata-way.”</p>

<p>Nannie laughed. In common with many others, she was fond of Johnny.</p>

<p>“You’re not expecting any mail?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, not exactly. Fact is, Miss Nannie, I want you to do me a
favor. And it ain’t downright reg’lar, either.”</p>

<p>Nannie perked up at once. “Oh, Mr. Allerdyce,” she cooed, “I’m dying to
know what it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell yuh. There was a man over in Standing Rock the other
night, and nobody could find out his name. I just bet I could. I know he
was allowin’ to come back here, and I surmise he gets mail here. His
initials are C. T. I told myself if anybody answered to that down here,
you’d know it.”</p>

<p>“C. T.?” queried Nannie, her memory being put to question. “C.
T.—Charles, Chris, Chester, Cleve—Cleve von Thurlow? No, that would be
C. V., wouldn’t it? Humph! Beats me.” And to show how positive her
statement was she reached for the letters in the T pigeonhole. Thumbing
them with a practiced hand she ran over them speedily. Johnny’s heart
was pounding heavily, for he was having the secrets of the United States
mails opened to him. Putting Nannie on her mettle had won where a more
direct method would have failed most miserably.</p>

<p>Johnny’s elation began to wane as the girl went on through the handful
of letters without pausing, and then, as he was about to give up hope,
Nannie flapped a letter to the counter.</p>

<p>“That’s him!” she exclaimed. “Crosbie Traynor! Must be, because here’s
another for him. Where was he from—Flagstaff?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Johnny assured her. “From down Arizona way. Crosbie
Traynor! Well, ma’am, it’s sure my treat. Next time you go by the Eagle
Drug, you stop in. There’ll be a box of candy there for you.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t do that, Mr. Allerdyce,” Nannie protested very prettily.
“You know that I usually do remember names; but we’ve been so busy.”</p>

<p>Johnny was in no mood to complain of this willing worker. “My laws, of
course!” he hastened to say. “Fools shouldn’t be coming around botherin’
you.”</p>

<p>And Johnny, further to show his gratitude, purchased a dollar’s worth of
stamps, for which he had absolutely no use. And, of course, Nannie’s
percentage didn’t hold good on the deal, either.</p>

<p>Johnny’s pace, when he had turned back on to Bridge Street, slowed
materially. He was too full for words. To go back to the hotel would be
to share his success with Tony, and he was not yet ready to do that. As
was habitual with him, he wanted to be alone to digest this latest
discovery. He found the proper place for it in the deserted waiting-room
at the Espee station.</p>

<p>His continual repetition of the dead man’s name might have been a
funeral chant, so often did he sound it.</p>

<p>“Crosbie Traynor.” A pause, then: “Crosbie Traynor. I’ve got the tracks
cleared now! I’ll see the Injuns first; but if I’m stopped there, I’m
goin’ on, even if it’s clear to Flagstaff!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Two o’clock found Johnny mounting the stairs to the Eldorado’s parlor.
Molly awaited him, but the boy found her cast down. Her appearance
prompted him to plain speaking.</p>

<p>“Listen, girl,” he said. “There’s somethin’ wrong. Now, tell me what it
is. I felt it this mornin’. It ain’t your way to steal off, and that’s
what you did this trip. You’re worried, and I know it.”</p>

<p>“I am, Johnny,” Molly answered readily. “I’d have told you without your
asking. I did come here hurriedly and without a word to any one. Maybe
I’ve been foolish, but it sounded so genuine that I had to do as I have.
I won’t talk in riddles any longer. Hughie brought me this letter night
before last. It rather upset me, and then, too, I was curious. I want
you to read it.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s face whitened as he obeyed her, for without question it was a
communication from Crosbie Traynor.</p>

<p>The letter ran:</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Miss Molly Kent</span>, Diamond-Bar Ranch:</p>

<p>“Please do not be alarmed by this letter. One who wishes you well writes
it. Although I am a stranger, I have traveled many hundred miles to see
you.</p>

<p>“I am an old man—old beyond my time. Seeing you is one of the two
ambitions I have left me. Let the fact that I have loved your mother,
living and dead, these forty years, explain my interest in you. It is of
her that I want to talk to you.</p>

<p>“Will you come to Winnemucca on the sixth? I’ll look for you in the
parlor of the Eldorado Hotel at noon.</p>

<p>“For reasons that you will understand then, I hope you will come alone
and that you will not go to the shipping pens until you have seen me.</p>

<p>“My name would mean nothing to you, so I will sign myself just</p>

<div style='text-align:right; font-variant:small-caps;'>“Your Friend.”</div>
</div>

<p>A sigh escaped Johnny as he handed back the letter.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you make of it?” Molly asked earnestly.</p>

<p>The boy could only shake his head. Here was the final proof of the dead
man’s interest in the girl Johnny loved. What lay in back of it was
still a closed book, but certainly Traynor had felt himself close to
her.</p>

<p>His death may have been without connection with his proposed intention
to see Molly, but Johnny just could not believe it.</p>

<p>There was old Kent’s attitude toward Johnny; the whole sorry business at
Standing Rock; the bickering; the stupidity of men who were solid
citizens.</p>

<p>Was it all a play, a staged show to block justice?</p>

<p>The boy tried to close his eyes to the pictures his sorely puzzled brain
conjectured, but in spite of every resolve an inner voice kept on
dinning in his ears: “Jackson Kent killed this man! Hired it done! Paid
for it!”</p>

<p>But why? Molly’s mother? What other reason could a rich man have for
ordering a crime of this sort?</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that Johnny’s excitement would escape Molly’s
eyes. In comparison she was less nervous than he.</p>

<p>“Are you reading something between the lines?” she demanded. “Your face
is white.”</p>

<p>“Miss Molly, how long have you been waiting?”</p>

<p>“On and off since eleven. But tell me, shouldn’t I have come? Don’t be
mysterious that way, Johnny. You actually frighten me.”</p>

<p>“No harm in coming,” he told her. He was only marking time. Johnny knew
that he would have to tell some part of what had happened to the man who
had written her this letter. “Can you make a guess as to who wrote that
note?” he went on, still playing against the minutes.</p>

<p>“Why, no. I haven’t the slightest memory of my mother. And I do believe
the man was what he claimed to be.”</p>

<p>“He was,” Johnny answered succinctly. “What you intendin’ doin’ now?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d wait here the rest of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Now he had to tell her.</p>

<p>“No use doin’ that, little girl. No use at all.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s manner brought the girl to her feet.</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you saying?” she asked falteringly.</p>

<p>“He won’t come.” The words left the boy’s lips slowly. “The man you’re
waiting for is dead!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Call it intuition, a sixth sense, or what you will, a feeling of loss
which she could not explain gripped Molly Kent. That Crosbie Traynor was
dead was tragic; that he had been killed was even more of a shock, but
it did not account for the grief which choked her.</p>

<p>Johnny told himself he had never been more witless. Why had he been so
abrupt? For the first time in his life he saw tears in Molly Kent’s
eyes, and questions which he would have to answer. But even though he
knew that she would have the facts from him, he still sought to withhold
them. This, of course, because he saw no way of telling the complete
truth without putting the girl’s father under suspicion.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes Johnny managed to become so involved that a child
would have known that he was telling less than half of what he knew. It
definitely added to Molly’s misery. Also, it awakened in her a sense of
shrewdness which left Johnny helpless.</p>

<p>“Just what did all this have to do with your leaving the Diamond-Bar?”
she asked flatly.</p>

<p>Johnny stumbled over his answer. “Why—er—nothin’,” he drawled.</p>

<p>Molly nodded her head sagaciously. She was not fooled.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” she said decisively. “You’ve been telling me only half the
truth. You were too painfully careful not to mention father’s name. Your
quarrel had something to do with Mr. Traynor’s death.”</p>

<p>Johnny hung his head, afraid to meet her eyes, or else he would have
seen the girl’s face pale.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Johnny,” she said with a queer little quaver in her voice, “is
father in trouble?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” she prompted.</p>

<p>The boy sighed heavily, continuing to look away.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to say nothin’ ’bout our run-in,” said he. “Now you’re
thinkin’ all sorts of things, and I got to tell you. Old Aaron’s a fool,
and he tried to shut me up. Couldn’t do it, though. Then the boss came
in and sided with him. That riled me, seein’ as how the man couldn’t
have killed hisself. I made some talk about findin’ out who did the
killin’, and I was told pretty plain that I could either punch cattle or
quit, that the Diamond-Bar wasn’t payin’ wages to have me goin’ around
snoopin’ into what didn’t concern me none.”</p>

<p>“I can just hear father saying that,” Molly declared. “You’ve got to
forgive him, Johnny. He’s so old; and he worries so lately. He helped to
elect Mr. Gallup. Naturally he couldn’t go back on him. Honestly, you
had me worried. I just couldn’t imagine what had happened. Don’t look so
glum. I’ll see that father asks you to come back.”</p>

<p>Johnny raised his head at that.</p>

<p>“No,” he said positively. “I wouldn’t do that. A girl couldn’t
understand it, I guess; but I’ll never ride for Diamond-Bar again.”</p>

<p>“Because of a few hot words?” Molly stopped abruptly, her eyes holding
Johnny’s. “Or else—” A shiver cascaded down the boy’s spine as he waited
for her to finish, “or else you think that he cut you short because he
had something to do with Mr. Traynor’s death. Is that what you think?”</p>

<p>Johnny’s face worked convulsively as he strove for an honest answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I think,” he said at last. “Whenever I lie to you
it’s because I want to save you from somethin’ I know’d hurt you. I’d
steal for you, Molly Kent; I’d lie and do ’most anythin’, but when you
ask me a straight question like that, I’ve got to shoot square. I tell
you I don’t know what I think!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Johnny, Johnny! You can’t mean that! You don’t think that my father
could have killed that man? Why, he’s been the salt of the earth to me.
No one has ever had to complain of him. You know what the last two
winters have been, and the price of steers ’way down. It’s been two
years of loss for him, and he’s too old to take it with a grin. He has
been short with Hobe, but Hobe overlooks it. He understands. But you,
Johnny—you suspect him—and of this. Aw-w-w!” A sob broke from her lips.
“And I had such faith in you, Johnny,” she muttered distractedly. “Do
you want to break my heart?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Molly, don’t—don’t let it matter,” pleaded Johnny, the
misery in his soul causing his voice to quaver. “What difference does it
make what I think?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be as honest as you,” Molly answered with a straightening of her
lips. “It means my happiness. Do you think I could let you go away
carrying that thought? You are no fool, Johnny Dice. Something more
definite than anything you’ve told me planted that ugly thought in your
mind. I want to know what it was. Don’t say you can’t tell me. Whatever
you say won’t shake my faith in my father. Jackson Kent’s name is
respected from one side of this State to the other. It’s not to defend
him that I implore you to speak. I want you set right. This letter
proves nothing. Mr. Traynor may have had many enemies. That he wanted to
see me to satisfy an old man’s whim was undoubtedly just the merest
coincidence. That in itself could not put my father under suspicion.
Could it?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t said that,” the unhappy Johnny replied. “It’s just my
foolishness.”</p>

<p>Glancing at Molly, he saw that she was re-reading the letter.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she demanded, “why did he ask me to keep away from the
shipping pens? I’d have no reason for going there.”</p>

<p>“I thought about that, too. It’s beyond me. All I know is that he was
coming back here today. Dan Secor told me that. He’d fixed a gun for
Traynor. Said he’d be back on the sixth.”</p>

<p>“The sixth—the sixth of October!”</p>

<p>The letter fluttered to the floor from the girl’s fingers as, white of
face, she sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Johnny!” she cried. “Oh, dear God! Don’t you see it—don’t you
understand? The Diamond-Bar has begun shipping from Winnemucca on the
sixth of October for three years. That is why he didn’t want me to go to
the pens. He thought father would be there.”</p>

<p>In a flash Johnny caught Traynor’s idea. If, as the boy had every reason
to suspect, old Kent was the man Traynor had come to square accounts
with, then he had the answer to the man’s every movement for a week
before his death. That is, of course, excepting those two mysterious
days on the Reservation. This coming back to Winnemucca was for three
purposes: to see the girl, to settle with Kent, and, obviously, to
replenish his funds, inasmuch as the letters from Flagstaff were from a
Flagstaff bank.</p>

<p>Traynor had told Vinnie, the Basque, that he would not stay the night in
Standing Rock. His one idea was to get back to Winnemucca by the sixth.
Going on this thought, Johnny saw that the man’s presence in Standing
Rock had been but incidental to his return here. But he had been seen.
Kent must have kept out of his way, and after, or during supper, had
slipped up to Traynor’s room and shot him.</p>

<p>Wasn’t there sense in every line of this reasoning? Didn’t all of the
dozen and one little incidents since the crime confirm the facts?</p>

<p>Johnny wondered if he would find out anything in Elk Valley among the
Indians, to make him change his mind. The evidence he held was
circumstantial. Sometimes it lies. No matter. There was nothing left for
him to do but to go through with this hunt, make the trip to Elk Valley
and keep his own counsel. In no other way could he serve Molly better.</p>

<p>He had bungled things or else he would have avoided this scene with her.
Her excitement and nervousness were due to him.</p>

<p>He detested himself for having alarmed her. Instead of the pleasant half
hour he had looked forward to, he had frightened and hurt her. The thing
to do now was to still any rising suspicion she might have and get her
started for home. So he made small of Molly’s deductions.</p>

<p>“Traynor may have been a friend of your father’s,” he said to her. “Or
again just another coincidence. As you rightly said, things like that
don’t prove a thing. Wasn’t nothin’ else planted a doubt in my mind, and
I see how downright senseless it was now.”</p>

<p>“Are you being honest with me, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Why don’t you take the night train to Argenta? Matt will see
that you git home. Won’t be no trouble sendin’ your horse out to the
ranch.”</p>

<p>“I guess that would be the best thing to do. But you, Johnny, what are
you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Goin’ over to the Injun country tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Elk Valley? What strange business is taking you there?”</p>

<p>“Crosbie Traynor. I aim to find out who killed him. He was on the
Reservation two days just before he came into the Rock. I reckon I’ll
find out who had it in for him over there. I owe it to you to clear up
this thing.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could go with you, but of course I can’t. Will you go in by
the way of the ranch? It’s not much farther than by way of the North
Fork.”</p>

<p>It was on Johnny’s tongue to say: “Of course, if you want me to,” but
hadn’t old Jackson Kent warned him off? Rebellion began to surge in
Johnny’s soul. Kent confronted him at every turn. And this would
continue to happen. It began to dawn upon the boy that things indeed
were at a pretty pass. It was squarely up to him to decide those little
questions of conduct by which he would either win or lose Molly Kent.
She was the stake.</p>

<p>Johnny knew that the old man would use any end to turn the girl against
him. So, naturally, he asked himself what he had to gain by walking wide
of the old cattleman. To defy her father might turn the girl against
him. Johnny wondered. Surely Molly would like him less if he turned tail
and ran. Yes, that was the correct answer, provided he considered
himself as only an undesirable suitor. But just how much did that enter
into the break between them?</p>

<p>To be frank, didn’t Jackson Kent see in him his accuser, the man whom he
feared? Therefore, Traynor’s death had to be explained before he could
hope for fair play from Kent. And Johnny was too pessimistic to believe
that when solution of the murder had been achieved it would prove
anything other than the old man’s guilt. Knowledge of that sort would
not heal the breach. They would go to their death bitter enemies.</p>

<p>Knowing Molly for the girl she was Johnny realized that she would never
go back on her father. The boy’s teeth sank into his lips. He saw now
just how hopeless his dreams were. There was a barrier between Molly and
him which could never be removed.</p>

<p>His head snapped back at the thought. Well, if it was written that he
had to lose her, he at least would go down fighting. To hell with
Jackson Kent! He was her father, but he was also a man. They were two
men facing each other, fighting for her love. Kent was old, but his
money and his power made it a fair fight. Let it ride!</p>

<p>Molly little guessed the thoughts racing through Johnny’s mind or
understood the tenseness of his voice as he answered her.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said slowly, “I’ll stop at the Diamond-Bar if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t!” came a startling interruption; “the last word I said to
you was ‘git!’ Keep off the Diamond-Bar! I might ’a’ known I’d find you
here fillin’ my girl’s head with your schemes and nonsense. I told you
before to git, and I tell it to you now! Go!”</p>

<p>Kent’s wrinkled face was crimson as he thundered on, and Molly’s knees
shook at his sudden appearance. Johnny’s eyes narrowed angrily at the
old man. How long he had been there in the doorway the boy did not know.
He must have crept up the stairs.</p>

<p>Beseechingly, Molly held out her arms to her father.</p>

<p>“Please, <i>father</i>,” she entreated, “don’t make a scene! Are you mad? You
didn’t have to steal upon us in this fashion. Whatever difference of
opinion there is between you two, it doesn’t call for this sort of
conduct.”</p>

<p>“So even you turn against me, eh? He’s poisoned your mind against me!”</p>

<p>“Stop! You don’t know what you are saying.”</p>

<p>“I do! He’s a treacherous leopard, the——”</p>

<p>Molly’s cheeks were the color of chalk. With clenched fists held to her
breasts she threw back her head and hurled her defiance at the old man.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried, her head thrown back. “No one, father, not even you,
can speak like that to me. Johnny Dice is my friend! I’d trust him with
my life!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXIV' title='XIV: FOR THE HEART OF A GIRL'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>FOR THE HEART OF A GIRL</span>
</h2>

<p>Something sang in the heart of Johnny Dice. The one being in the world
who mattered had faith in him. The impulse to take her into his arms at
this moment almost overcame him. He had seen Molly Kent under varied
circumstances, but never so superb as now. She was all woman; mature
where Johnny had believed her mere girl. The sight of her so aroused, so
alive, thrilled him in a manner quite new.</p>

<p>Whatever had gone before was as nothing now. Life began here. Down
through the years his memories of Molly Kent would date from this
moment, so utterly did his spirit bend to worship her.</p>

<p>It had needed a moment as dramatic as this to awaken the boy to the
enormity of his loss should he lose her.</p>

<p>And, although he was enraged, Jackson Kent’s eyes had been opened, too.
He saw the abyss yawning at his feet, and an abyss it was, indeed—the
losing of his girl! Death was trivial beside it. Old age was upon him
and it frightened Jackson Kent to the very marrow to consider the
future, robbed of Molly’s great love. And it would get to that if this
man came between them.</p>

<p>In his day Kent had held himself a hard man, cold, unemotional; asking
affection of none. But, as so often happens with men of his type, he
gave when he least suspected it, and now that the tide had set the other
way he knew his need. Often he had fooled himself into worshiping his
money. His false god mocked him.</p>

<p>His hungry heart needed Molly, not money! And he swore that he would
have her; that Johnny Dice should never see her again. Had the fool
bewitched the girl? Wait until she heard how he had been caught skulking
in her room. Yes, and his insolence at the Rock; she’d resent that.
There was good steel in Molly. This Dice person would find that the
Kents stuck together!</p>

<p>And, oh, how he hated Johnny! Anger surged through his brain in blinding
waves until his withered old body trembled. Had he been at all
apoplectic, Jackson Kent would have been stricken dead.</p>

<p>Poor Molly winced as she regarded him. She had insisted on fair play,
but without intending to wound her father. What had got into folks
lately to make them fly at each others’ throats in this fashion?
Thoroughly distressed, she said:</p>

<p>“Father, I’m sorry I hurt you. I didn’t mean to be impertinent.”</p>

<p>The old man unbent readily enough.</p>

<p>“No matter,” he said, opening his arms to her. “I’m not angry with you.
This man here is the person I’ve got my quarrel with. You look tired,
nervous. I’ll get you a room and you go and lie down for a spell. When
you’re rested up we’ll go home. Anythin’ we’ve got to say to each other
we can say when we’re alone.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that is best; but while the three of us are here, father, I want
to ask you one question. Did you know Crosbie Traynor?”</p>

<p>The suddenness of the question startled Johnny. He thought he saw the
old man sway and struggle for breath even as his head shook his denial
of any knowledge of the dead man. The next instant there was a grim
smile on Kent’s lips. It made Johnny, who knew not the cost of it, open
his eyes still wider.</p>

<p>“Traynor?” Kent questioned. “Crosbie Traynor? No, I never heard of him.
Is he a friend of this man?”</p>

<p>The question was ingenious. Johnny recovered his tongue in time to
answer for himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anythin’ about him to make me ashamed to call him friend.”</p>

<p>“Your standard ain’t high,” snapped the old man. “A person who’ll go
snoopin’ round a girl’s bedroom ain’t likely to pick his friends
carefully.”</p>

<p>The inference was too thinly veiled to escape Molly.</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, father. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll explain. He knows what I mean. I figured he wouldn’t be
sayin’ anythin’ about that to you. I caught him red-handed, I tell you.
Snoopin’ in your room, where no man has ever set his foot—not even me.
Wa’n’t anybody to home but the Chink and Hughie. Just the chance he was
lookin’ for. Am I lyin’?” he demanded of Johnny.</p>

<p>The boy’s cheeks were scarlet! Molly was staring at him amazedly. With a
clicking of syllables Johnny’s answer leaped from his lips:</p>

<p>“Since you speak of it, tell her the whole truth!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I intend!” Turning to Molly the old man said: “When I
surprised him, he made a lot of talk about bringin’ you a present. Ain’t
no need of a forty-dollar-a-month cowpunch spendin’ his money bringin’
you presents, and lookin’ for some favor in return. Ain’t nothin’ money
would buy that I’ve ever refused you.”</p>

<p>Molly tried to protest, but the old man waved her down.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me I’m puttin’ it too strong. He’s got his eye set on you;
told me so to my face.”</p>

<p>Kent saw bitter tears flood the girl’s eyes, but he went on.</p>

<p>“This is all true talk, Molly,” he asserted. “Look at the man—he may be
a romantic figure in your eyes, seein’ you’re so young, but I’m tellin’
you that nine months a year he’s flat broke! It’d take him three months
to earn the price of the dress you’re wearin’. I ain’t raised you
careful-like, givin’ you every advantage a girl ought to have to see you
waste yourself on a forty-dollar man!”</p>

<p>Level-eyed now, Molly searched the faces of the two men before her.
Johnny Dice had spoken no word of love to her. Yes, but love was not a
thing of words. It was something that came to life of its own volition,
and grew and grew until it caught the hearts of men and women in a vise.
Only when it had made its presence known would retrospection reveal the
hundred little ways in which it had sought to announce itself from the
very beginning.</p>

<p>Molly was permitted such a moment. What she beheld left her body
trembling. Was this love? Did she love Johnny Dice? The thought had
never occurred to her before. Was this feeling of comradeship, this boy
and girl friendship, love? At least the thought was not unpleasant to
her. Poor he might be, but Johnny was too much a man to be unworthy of
love. The more she thought of it the greater became the tug on her
heart. Anger, resentment, all her other emotions were blotted out. Even
her insistence on fair play between the two men became less vital to the
girl.</p>

<p>Whether she knew it or not, Molly was taking sides. And, as women have
done down through the ages, she turned from her own to champion the man
who desired her. She was no longer the judge, but the counsel for the
defense.</p>

<p>“Were you better off at his age, father?” she asked.</p>

<p>Kent must have sensed the widening between them, for he answered almost
surlily: “Times have changed. What was good enough for me ain’t good
enough for you. Did he show you the picture of you he’s got in his
pocket? Your picture—carryin’ it around!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, father. I can’t believe it. I haven’t had a picture taken in
years.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was years since this one was took. You know the one you’ve got
framed and hanging beside your door? He’s got a copy of it. I asked him
for it. I don’t want my little girl’s picture goin’ the rounds of the
cow camps. He wouldn’t give it up. Said he’d ask you if he could keep
it. He didn’t, did he? Made some wild talk about its belonging to a dead
man.”</p>

<p>“Dead man!” The words chilled the girl.</p>

<p>She turned questioningly to Johnny. With rising suspicion she saw the
boy nod his head in answer to the interrogation in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me see it!” she demanded, stretching out her hands toward Johnny,
who was drawing the picture from his pocket.</p>

<p>One glance at it was enough for the girl.</p>

<p>“Father!” she exclaimed. “It <i>is</i> my picture.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” the old man snapped. “Ask him how he came by it.”</p>

<p>“Johnny, tell me,” Molly cried, “what does it all mean? What is this
talk of ‘dead man’? From whom did you get this picture?”</p>

<p>And now Johnny faced Kent.</p>

<p>“From Crosbie Traynor,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“From Crosbie Traynor,” Molly repeated slowly.</p>

<p>The old man’s smile failed him this time. He choked over his words as he
fought to repress his excitement. “Traynor! Traynor!” he cried at last.
“What’s all this talk of him?”</p>

<p>Molly was sobbing.</p>

<p>“Father, father,” she murmured, “I’m so afraid, so frightened. This
picture, this letter, death, murder—what does it mean, what does it
mean?”</p>

<p>The letter crinkled in Kent’s bony hands as he tried to hold it steady
enough to read it. He seemed to sicken as he read; lines came into his
face; he breathed with difficulty; with shaking hands he clutched at his
collar to loosen it.</p>

<p>As the button snapped under the strain and his hand came away he flashed
a glance at the boy. Quick, ferretlike, it was.</p>

<p>Johnny’s face was wooden. Even his eyes were emotionless. For the moment
Molly was unconscious of his presence. Dumbly she stared at the older
man. She saw him sink into a chair, gasping for breath; but she did not
run to his side to comfort him. Something unexplainable made her draw
back. And she knew that she did, and the knowledge crucified her. A
blush of shame mounted to her cheeks—that she could watch the misery of
her own and be untouched by it. And she felt herself urged on. This was
not yet the end.</p>

<p>“Father,” she heard herself saying, “do you understand that reference to
my not going near the shipping pens? The Diamond-Bar shipped from here
on the sixth last year and the year before. Mr. Traynor thought you
would be there. Please don’t lie to me, father. You can’t deny that you
knew this man.”</p>

<p>Seconds slipped by, with Kent’s spasmodic breathing the only sound to
break the stillness.</p>

<p>At last the old man spoke.</p>

<p>“No, Molly,” he said with an effort. “I can’t deny it any longer. I knew
Traynor. You’ve never heard his name on my lips before. Your mother knew
him, too. God forbid that you should. Trouble always followed him. He
was such another as this man here. He made my life a hell. I didn’t want
anythin’ but to keep out of his way. I never expected to see him again.
A skunk is always a skunk. I’m glad he’s dead!”</p>

<p>“Then you recognized him the other night in Standing Rock, eh?” Johnny
asked.</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you admit it?”</p>

<p>“Are you dumb enough to ask that? Do you think I wanted my girl’s name
mixed up with a killin’? Ain’t no Kent goin’ to be mixed up like that.
Me and mine stay clean. Let the dead take care of themselves. No one but
you figured he’d been killed. Plain enough he did it himself. He was
that kind. If he figured on meetin’ me here, it was to make a touch. But
he’s dead now and he’ll stay dead. He’s gone where he’ll never put the
tongues of folks on my child. Whether he killed himself or was murdered
makes no difference to me.”</p>

<p>“Justice don’t mean anythin’ to you, eh?”</p>

<p>“You’ve known me for nigh on ten years. You can take your own answer to
your question from that. Traynor was a lowdown, ornery reptile. He
didn’t get less than his deserts!”</p>

<p>Johnny shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said grimly, “but I don’t believe you. I’ll have my own
answer before I’m through. No act or word of mine will bring any harm to
your daughter. Her good opinion of me is the most precious thing I
possess. I aim to keep it. I can’t figure any easier way to lose it than
to let her think I’m two-faced. I finish what I start! You’ve made me
look small with your talk and insinuations. If I didn’t tell her about
the picture and of my own run-in with you, it was because I knew she was
too upset to hear it now. But I said I’d ask her—and I’m doin’ it this
minute.”</p>

<p>Johnnie turned his back on the old man and came close to Molly’s side.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard it all, Molly,” said Johnny. “You know what I’m askin’—I
want to keep that picture. Am I fit to have it?”</p>

<p>Without looking up, Molly handed the picture to him. It was a confession
of faith well calculated to arouse the best in the boy.</p>

<p>“And about my comin’ to the ranch,” he went on. “If you asked me to come
tomorrow I’d come, and nothin’ wouldn’t stop me. But I can’t see that it
would serve any purpose. From now on I go alone. Even Tony stays behind.
As it is, I’ve not been frank with him. What I find out no one but me’ll
know. If there’s talk you’ll know who to blame. If ever you want me, you
get word to the Basque; he’ll find me. And—<i>good-bye</i>.”</p>

<p>He was gone; nor did he hear the girl’s softly murmured answer.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>MADEIRAS GETS A CHANCE</span>
</h2>

<p>Molly had quite forgotten that the Langwell girls had arranged a bridge
party for her that afternoon. When three o’clock passed and their guest
had not returned, Miss Sue Langwell set out to find her.</p>

<p>Bridge was remote from Molly’s mind, but Sue’s interruption was welcomed
by old Jackson and he urged the girl to run along. Molly, with
pardonable caution, tried to conceal her distraught condition and keep
from her friend’s eyes any inkling of what had occurred. To succeed, she
allowed herself to be carried off.</p>

<p>With gratitude in his heart, Kent watched the two girls ride away in
Sue’s car. It effectually put an end to talk. There had been too much of
that already this day. So while Molly played cards and the old man
sought forgetfulness in the doing of purely routine business, Johnny
talked to old Dan Secor.</p>

<p>Dan had exhausted himself at noon, so Johnny went back to Tony.</p>

<p>Madeiras was in a bad humor. He had been waiting these many hours for
Johnny and felt himself slighted, left out of something.</p>

<p>Your Basque is thin-skinned and quick to resent a fancied hurt.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Johnny asked.</p>

<p>“Too much,” replied Tony. “For why I come wit’ you? I don’ lak theese
bus’ness, always be left behin’.”</p>

<p>The last hour had frayed Johnny’s nerves. The Basque’s petulance found
him without the patience to accept it for what it was. “Don’t ride me,
Tony,” he grumbled. “I know what I’m doin’.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí!</i> But <i>Madre de Dios</i>, I be dam’ eef I do!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you willin’ to follow my lead? When you stay back, it’s because
it’s best you do. We ain’t on no picnic. Things may break so that you’ll
go on and I’ll stay behind.”</p>

<p>“I guess you no stay behin’ much, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Well, you threw up your job for me. We stick till this thing’s over and
we’ve caught on somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Those job mean not’ing. Tony Madeiras always get job.”</p>

<p>“Then what in hell’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>The Basque grinned. He was getting a little action at last. “Maybe,” he
said bombastically, “Tony Madeiras mak’ good deetecteeve, too. But how I
know. I don’t get no chance.”</p>

<p>“Just what is it that you want to do?” demanded Johnny.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I go ask Kent for my job. Mebbe somet’ing happen on the
Diamond-Bar. Mebbe that old fool t’ink I go back on you, eh? Then Tony
Madeiras use hees nose and hees eyes.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Johnny cried as he banged the table. “You’re
elected—unanimously! I’m goin’ to Elk Valley in half an hour. You stay
behind. Kent’s still here. Meet him. Let him see that you’ve turned me
down. He’ll jump at the chance to hire you on. Miss Molly’ll hate you.
Play it out, though. If you think you ought to see me, come to the
Reservation. The agent will know where I am.”</p>

<p>Tony’s good nature blossomed again. Intrigue held a peculiar bouquet for
the Basque. Danger, adventure—hadn’t his race answered to them for
centuries?</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Johnny came downstairs by himself. A drink, and a
farewell nod to Whitey, the bartender, and he was off.</p>

<p>Kent saw him go, and followed his progress until the boy was lost in the
dust and heat waves dancing about the base of Winnemucca Mountain.
Turning back to the hotel office the old man saw Tony. The Basque was
pounding upon the desk for the clerk. “How much I owe theese place?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“Not a cent. Your pal paid the bill.”</p>

<p>“Johnny Dice, he’s no pal wit’ me,” the Basque announced angrily.
“Remember this: Tony Madeiras pay hees own way.”</p>

<p>He knew that Kent was listening, but he never glanced in the cattleman’s
direction. Instead, he stamped into the bar and ordered a drink. There
he poured into Whitey’s ear the story of his break with Johnny.</p>

<p>“You t’ink I stay behin’, me? No! I am a Madeiras. I belong up front,
you bat my life on that.”</p>

<p>Head erect, Tony started for the door. Kent was waiting for him. When
the Basque reached the sidewalk the old man stopped him.</p>

<p>“What’s all this talk?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m t’rough wit’ Johnny Dice,” the Basque said explosively. “I lose my
job for heem. He say we catch man what keel those fellow at the Rock.
How I catch heem, when all the time I’m tol’ to keep shut up—don’ say
not’ing, don’ do not’ing. <i>Válgame Dios!</i> You t’ink Tony Madeiras ees
dam fool?”</p>

<p>“You’ve acted like it,” old Kent declared. “Winter’s comin’ on; you had
a good job, but you threw it up for a harum-scarum kid. Didn’t take you
long to find out where you stood with him, did it? Smart Alecks don’t go
far. Guess you’ll learn.”</p>

<p>“I learn pretty dam’ good, all right,” Tony admitted. “Now I go look for
job.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find the lookin’ too good,” the boss of the Diamond-Bar
assured him.</p>

<p>“Well, Tony Madeiras ees good vaquero. No man deny that. Mebbe you tak’
me on again, eh?”</p>

<p>Kent was no fool. He had felt this question a full half minute before it
was asked. He was only too glad to get the man; but he shrewdly forced
the Basque to his knees.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” he said. “We don’t need men till spring. If I did
take you on, chances are you’d be flyin’ up and walkin’ off first time
you felt like it. If a man is workin’ for me, he’s workin’ for <i>me</i>. I
don’t have to put up with the sort of nonsense you and that
slipper-tongue tried to run on me.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I’m beeg fool once, but not beeg fool twice.”</p>

<p>“If you mean it,” Kent said dictatorially, “you’re on. You got your
horse and stuff here, ain’t yuh? Well, git my girl’s pony and head for
the ranch. I’ll be there before you come.”</p>

<p>It was the old man’s intention to take the train for Argenta that
evening, and drive to the ranch from there. He wondered what Molly would
say when she learned of Tony’s return to the Diamond-Bar fold. The
thought was uppermost in his mind as he left the hotel. He had Johnny
“on his own” now, and Kent felt that he had gained a definite advantage.</p>

<p>Long before he met Molly the old man had determined not to say a word
about the incident to her. If he did she would be apt to resent his
hiring the Basque. Let her find out for herself. It wouldn’t hurt to
have her hear Johnny Dice’s shortcomings retailed by other lips than
his.</p>

<p>Molly and the Langwell girls came for Kent at six and carried him off to
the Langwell home for supper. Molly seemed in better spirits and old
Jackson felt relieved. He tried to inveigle the girls into accompanying
them to the Diamond-Bar. They begged off for this time.</p>

<p>Molly guessed the reason in back of the invitation. With the Langwell
girls on hand there would have been little or no chance for a resumption
of the scenes of this afternoon. It would have only delayed matters.
Molly intended to know more about Crosbie Traynor before the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p>The ride to Argenta took but little time. The drive to the ranch,
however, was a matter of some three hours. The old man outdid himself in
trying to keep Molly’s mind far from Johnny Dice and the dead man. He
exhausted himself before the ranch was reached, and dreaded the
remaining miles. Molly, however, surprised him by not once referring to
the subject which obsessed both of them. It was not delicacy on the
girl’s part which made her hold her tongue. She had heard more than
enough for the present. It was her way to ponder over a matter for a day
or two. Questions would be asked and she would be answered, but not
tonight.</p>

</h2>

<p>For all of the old man’s talk there was plenty to do on the Diamond-Bar.
The men were back from the Rock, but early the following morning big
Hobe had sent them off on various tasks so that life on the ranch moved
as usual.</p>

<p>Before noon Tony arrived. Molly’s eyes opened as she saw who it was that
led her pony into the yard. A dozen questions leaped to her mind. She
even looked about for Johnny. What could the Basque be doing here?</p>

<p>Five minutes of heated conversation with Tony told her what she wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“As long as I live,” she advised him, “I shall never again trust a
Basque. That Johnny wronged you unintentionally doesn’t enter into it.
He thought so much of you. You were pals. Humph, pals! A pal sticks
right or wrong.” Molly turned back to the house. “I hope your horse
throws you and breaks your wretched neck,” she hurled at him for a
parting shot.</p>

<p>Tony winced. He had received more than he had bargained for, but he was
game. He clucked his tongue to show his utter contempt for Johnny Dice.</p>

<p>Infuriated, Molly slammed the door behind her. The old man had seen this
pass-at-arms, and although he had heard no word of it, he could guess
what had been said. He promised himself that it was only the beginning.
Before he was through Molly would be thoroughly disillusioned as far as
Johnny Dice was concerned.</p>

<p>Noontime brought two visitors to the Diamond-Bar—Aaron Gallup and his
“man Friday,” Tobias Gale.</p>

<p>Aaron made a business of loaning money at six or seven per cent on first
mortgages. Tobias saw to the details, such little matters as the rate,
for instance. He was a Dickensian character, humble to self-effacement,
but always driving a hard bargain. More than one rancher in Ruby Valley
had cause to regret Tobias.</p>

<p>The man moved in an aura of gloom. His was a funereal appearance,
clothes of ancient cut, once black, but long since faded to a dull
bottle-green. His coming to a ranch-house was equivalent to the visit of
the undertaker. No one knew his age, but if it were to be guessed from
his wrinkled, mummified face one would have put him down for eighty.</p>

<p>Tobias was a usurer, intended from birth for his present calling. Old
Aaron had given him his opportunity and he rewarded the coroner with
faithful service.</p>

<p>Gallup no longer rode in a saddle. He had a weatherbeaten old buckboard
and a pair of mean-eyed mustangs to get him about. This turnout, when
not in use by Aaron, served Tobias. So the rig and its span of ponies
came to be associated with bad luck, hard times and overdue interest
money. That is, it did when only one of the precious pair adorned it.
Whenever Aaron and Tobias appeared together it meant more than overdue
payments; it spelled foreclosure!</p>

<p>Jackson Kent thought of this as he caught sight of the two men.</p>

<p>“Howdy!” Gallup called as he pulled up his team.</p>

<p>“What are you two birds of prey doin’ here today?” Kent called jestingly
as he walked out to the rig. “Ain’t come to foreclose?”</p>

<p>Tobias cackled at his pleasantry. Gallup chose to be more serious.
“Wouldn’t be so bold as that about it,” he said. “Just come to talk
things over a little. Saw some of your boys a ways back. I seen Madeiras
as we turned in. What’s he doin’ here?”</p>

<p>“Back on his job,” Kent grinned. “He had more sense than you allowed
him.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” Gallup answered. “Where’s that rearin’, tearin’ Dice
person? Bet he ain’t back.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never git back! Where he is or what he’s doin’ don’t interest me.
Hey, you, Charlie Paul!” Kent called to his Piute teamster. “Take care
of this team.”</p>

<p>The three men entered Kent’s office as the Indian led away the horses.</p>

<p>“Well, what you got on your mind, Aaron?” the cowman asked when they
were seated.</p>

<p>“Two or three things. Come to think of it, that remark of yours about
foreclosin’ wa’n’t so wide of the mark, only it ain’t a matter of
money—that is, not exactly—that I’m thinkin’ about. To be right
truthful, Jackson, it’s a promise of yours I came to foreclose on.”</p>

<p>“In regard to the notes?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o. In regard to the girl.”</p>

<p>“Molly?”</p>

<p>“You guessed it. Last time I was here, some four months ago, you
promised me you’d talk to her. I ain’t forgot how she treated me, but I
don’t carry no grudges. I’m here today to ask her again.”</p>

<p>Kent’s face fell as he heard the man declare himself.</p>

<p>“Ain’t been four months, has it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Four months to the day,” Gallup stated. “That’s correct, ain’t it,
Toby?”</p>

<p>Aaron’s factotum nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem so long as that to me,” Jackson said unhappily. “Maybe we’d
better talk this over just between the two of us,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“No-o-o. Toby knows my dark side. I ain’t got no secrets from him.”</p>

<p>“Your dark side, eh?” Kent queried. “I’ve heard tell as how you were
pretty well tanned all over, Aaron.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. When a man owes you money, he can find a lot to tell about
you. I don’t mean that personal. You know how it is—men borrow money and
then they don’t want to pay it back. Makes a hard name for the folks
what does the lendin’. Speakin’ of money, it just reminds me that I’ve
got close to a hundred thousand dollars out on interest now. Toby can
give you the exact figgers. That ought to make a little difference with
the girl.”</p>

<p>“Won’t make no difference with her,” Kent declared. “She’s always known
her own mind; but even so, she’s changed since you saw her last. She
defied me yesterday for the first time in her life. The girl’s
bewitched. She thinks she’s in love with Johnny Dice.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t tellin’ me any news,” Gallup muttered. “I been suspectin’
that this long time—another reason why I’m here today. You better tell
her I’ve come. I want to talk to her.”</p>

<p>Kent got to his feet uneasily. Biting the ends of his mustache he took a
turn around his desk.</p>

<p>“Man, I can’t do it!” he exclaimed at last. “This, on top of what we
were through yesterday, will turn her against me for life.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jackson, a promise is a promise. You don’t want to forget that in
more ways than one you owe this ranch to me. It was me who gave you a
start. Whenever you needed help you’ve always come to me. I’m old, I
know. I ain’t askin’ her to love me. Love is for young bucks.</p>

<p>“I’m a man of means, now. Mrs. Aaron Gallup will be a somebody in this
country long after I’ve cashed in. She’s got youth, she’s pretty, and
that’s what I want. When we run down to Frisco folk’ll turn and look
twice at her; like as not they’ll have pictures in the papers, too, of
her and me. We’ll let ’em know we’re somebody. And that’s what I want.
It’s what I’ve been wantin’ all the years I’ve been savin’ pennies and
cheatin’ myself out of things no man should be without.”</p>

<p>“But it’s sellin’ her,” Kent groaned. “Sellin’ her like she was a slave.
Maybe I’ve been dreamin’ my dreams too. What’s goin’ to happen to me, an
old man, without her? I’ve slaved and cheated myself even as you have.
It was for her. Don’t smile at me like that. You’re hearin’ the truth.
Damn it, I tell you, I’ll let you cut off my right arm before I’ll see
her your wife.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I don’t know about that,” Gallup drawled menacingly. “Right
arms ain’t so precious. Maybe you’re forgettin’ that I’m holding your
paper for thirty thousand dollars. It’s overdue, too. The way the market
is, don’t seem as if there’d be much chance of your payin’ up right
off.”</p>

<p>“The ranch is worth five times the amount I owe you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course. Tobias consented to the loans, didn’t he? Toby
don’t get over his head.”</p>

<p>“Are you puttin’ it flat to me, then, that you git my girl, or else you
foreclose on my paper?”</p>

<p>“You understand me perfectly, Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, foreclose, and to hell with you!” Kent roared, supreme for
the moment.</p>

<p>Gallup did not move, neither did his eyes leave Jackson’s face. A minute
passed before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes? You’re goin’ to make a pauper out of her, eh, so Dice can put
himself in her class and run off with her? You’d better reconsider. Toby
and me’ll go outside and look around the place while you do.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>GALLUP’S PRICE</span>
</h2>

<p>Kent slunk into his chair as they left him. He had foreseen this day,
but events had so happened since the steer-shipping as to leave his mind
no time to worry about it. But now, by comparison, Johnny Dice and his
evil genius seemed of minor importance. Not for a second did Kent think
of begging off. He knew Gallup too well.</p>

<p>Yes, and Gallup knew Jackson Kent. Five years before this he would not
have dared to beard him as he had done this day. But Kent was no longer
the man of old. The last two years had been too much for the cattleman.
Every ounce of his energy had gone into fighting the perverse fate which
lately seemed to pursue all cattlemen.</p>

<p>So, while Kent drank the dregs of despair, Aaron and Tobias wandered
about, confident that old Jackson would back down. What was left of the
man’s fighting spirit might disintegrate slowly, but time would
accomplish it.</p>

<p>Half an hour sufficed—thirty minutes of life which Jackson Kent would
never forget. Slow of step and heavy of heart he made his way to Molly’s
room.</p>

<p>The girl glanced sharply at him as she noted his nervousness.</p>

<p>“We’ve got visitors,” the old man began.</p>

<p>“Madeiras, you mean,” Molly exclaimed. “What is he doing here?”</p>

<p>“Begged me for a job. Hobe needs him, so I let him come.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that he was the man you had found to bring out
my pony?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Molly. The two of us are at swords’ points all the time
lately. I knew if I told you that Tony had broken with Dice, that you’d
think I’d had somethin’ to do with it. The Basque came to me; I didn’t
seek him out. But no matter, it ain’t Madeiras I’m referrin’ to now;
it’s Gallup and Tobias Gale. Maybe you can guess what Gallup wants. It
breaks my heart to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, father!” Molly cried. “Do I have to go through with that
again? I promise you I’ll kill myself before I’ll marry that man.”</p>

<p>“I begged off the last time he was here,” the old man wailed. “I can’t
do it today. You don’t know it, but Gallup’s holdin’ my paper for thirty
thousand dollars. It’s overdue. He’s demandin’ his money or you. I told
him to foreclose, and he laughed at me. He doesn’t want the money,
little girl. It’s you he’s aimin’ to take away from me.</p>

<p>“When he was here four months ago, I told him I’d try to talk you into
marryin’ him. I hadn’t no intention of doin’ that. I figured prices were
goin’ up and that come shippin’ time they be high enough to give me the
cash to square up with him. The market didn’t go thata-way, though. Now
he wants me to trade you like a slave so that I can keep the ranch. And
that after tellin’ me he’s got over a hundred thousand out at from six
per cent up. What am I goin’ to do? Tell me that, little girl, what am I
goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>The old man choked over his words, and turned his head away as tears
filled his eyes.</p>

<p>Unable to control herself, Molly threw her arms about his neck. “Buck
up, father,” she pleaded. “Let me talk to him. He’ll not frighten me.”</p>

<p>Molly was as good as her word.</p>

<p>“Tell that man to leave the room,” she ordered, pointing to Tobias.
“What I have to say to you I’ll not say before him. Make him go!”</p>

<p>Tobias went.</p>

<p>“Now Aaron Gallup,” Molly rushed on, “just what have you come to say?”</p>

<p>Aaron steeled himself for his answer. “I’ve come to ask you to marry
me,” he said.</p>

<p>“You have, eh? Have you forgotten what I told you the last time you were
here? Do you think you are less unlovely to me today than you were
then?”</p>

<p>“Reckon not,” Aaron mumbled. “Looks ain’t my long suit. Looks in a man
ain’t worth nothin’. It’s wimmen that needs looks—wimmen like you. You
got looks enough for both of us.”</p>

<p>“You are a fool!” the girl exclaimed angrily. “No wonder Johnny Dice
laughed at you. When he finds out who killed Crosbie Traynor he’ll show
you out of Shoshone County for the imbecile that you are!”</p>

<p>“Crosbie Traynor?” Aaron asked, eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>“Yes, Crosbie Traynor! You didn’t even know the man’s name. Johnny has
only begun. He won’t give up until he can prove who killed that man.”</p>

<p>“So?” Aaron questioned provokingly. “You seem to be partial to Johnny
Dice. Your father tells me you think you’re in love with him.”</p>

<p>“Father knows more than I do if he told you that. But when I compare
Johnny Dice with such as you I’m almost convinced that I do love him.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you ain’t goin’ to listen to your father.” Gallup shook
his head pityingly. “Too bad. He’s worked hard for you. It’ll kill him
to lose this place, and lose it he will if you keep on. Children ain’t
like they used to be. Time was when a girl did as her father asked.”</p>

<p>Molly turned questioningly to Jackson Kent.</p>

<p>“Father!” she queried. “Are you asking me to marry this man?”</p>

<p>Jackson wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Molly,” he said with a sigh. “Would it be too hard on
yuh? Gallup’s got money; you’d have everything you’d want.”</p>

<p>“So you would,” Aaron hastened to supplement. “I ain’t askin’ for love.
I’d treat you kind. Ain’t nothin’ I wouldn’t do for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to seem ungrateful or be disloyal, or go back on my
own flesh and blood; but in my heart I believe you are both against me.
If I refuse to marry this man I condemn my father to poverty; and if I
take him I condemn my own soul. Oh, God, what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry too much about my soul if I was you,” Aaron confided
to her. “Souls have a way of takin’ care of themselves. They ain’t under
any expense.”</p>

<p>“What a fitting estimate of yourself, Aaron Gallup!” Molly cried
scathingly. “No! I shall not marry you. Never! I will repay my father
even as he paid me—with my youth. He toiled and slaved for me; I’ll do
the same. If we lose the ranch I’ll work as no woman ever worked
before—nothing shall be too hard for me; but I will not marry <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>Gallup got to his feet. “You think it over tonight,” he advised. “Your
father’ll see that you don’t run away. I’ll be back tomorrow for my
answer. And I’ll have a deputy sheriff and a minister with me. It will
be up to you to decide which man we’ll need.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>“KILL HIM, THE THIEF!”</span>
</h2>

<p>Late evening of the day on which he had left, Winnemucca saw Johnny
encamped on the North Fork for the night. Early the following morning he
breakfasted on trout and flap-jacks and essayed going over the hills in
an airline to the Reservation.</p>

<p>The creek was soon left behind. On the high rimrocks and hills above it
there was no trail, and the boy spent tedious hours in picking out his
way. At high noon he began dropping into the valley.</p>

<p>He had no plan of procedure, so quite naturally he first made for the
Agency. The Agent was not there; but he found Bill Ames, the post
trader, at home. Bill had seen no strangers in the last week or two.
Maybe Thunder Bird had. Indians never talked much. Johnny could ask him.
The old chief and his sons were killing rabbits down below.</p>

<p>Down below Johnny went.</p>

<p>“How, chief?” he greeted the old man, a creature of unassailable dignity
even in his rags. “You catch ’em rabbits, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nah! Boy catch ’em. Me too old.”</p>

<p>There was a note of resignation in the old chief’s answer quite beyond
what the words themselves convey. Men said that Thunder Bird remembered
the Forty-Niners and the Donner party. It might have been even as they
said, for there was a look in the chief’s eyes as old as the beginning
of time.</p>

<p>Johnny spread his blanket and beckoned to the aged Indian to be seated.
This formality accomplished, the boy opened a tin of tobacco and poured
its contents on to the blanket. With his fingers he divided it. Not in
equal portions. Oh, no! As he originally poured the piles they were
approximately even, but without glancing up the boy kept on transferring
small pinches of the tobacco from his own to the chief’s portion until
Thunder Bird’s share was four times Johnny’s.</p>

<p>Then he produced cigarette papers, and from his share rolled cigarettes
for the old man. To attempt to describe the expression on Thunder Bird’s
face as he watched Johnny would be wasted effort. The chief’s hair was
white, his face gaunt, shriveled; his jaws toothless; if such a
combination can mirror the innocence of childhood it was achieved in the
old Piute.</p>

<p>In back of him, at a respectable distance, Thunder Bird’s squaw sat,
expressionless, watching the dumb show.</p>

<p>“<i>Hé</i>,” the old man grunted at last. “Mebbe you come look for mine this
time.”</p>

<p>“No look for mine, Thunder Bird. Look for stranger—white man. You see
him on Reservation last two moons?”</p>

<p>The Indian did not answer for several minutes. Then:</p>

<p>“No see um stranger.”</p>

<p>“Rode a stallion, big horse—a roan,” Johnny persisted.</p>

<p>“Spanish horse, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s it—Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I see um.” A pause, and then a shrug of the shoulders. “No can
tell. Too old. Why you want um? Steal horse?”</p>

<p>Johnny tried hard to conceal his impatience.</p>

<p>“No steal ’em horse,” he answered. Johnny spread his fingers, palms up.
“Him friend—<i>un ladrón le ha muerto</i>!”</p>

<p>“Ah, nah—dead?”</p>

<p>For an instant the old chief’s eyes seemed to lose their guile. Johnny’s
pulse quickened at what he thought was a note of concern in Thunder
Bird’s voice.</p>

<p>“Dead,” he repeated. “Maybe you see him, Thunder Bird?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so boy see um,” the chief countered. “You come tomorrow, eh?”</p>

<p>Johnny knew it would be useless to urge haste. Tomorrow he would have
his answer and not sooner. It would be an answer worth waiting for. If
Thunder Bird had known Traynor and had had a hand in his death, then he
would deny everything tomorrow. If Traynor had been his friend, the
Indian would speak out. If neither of these suppositions were true, it
followed that Thunder Bird’s runners would comb the Reservation. If
Traynor had set foot in Elk Valley the Piute chief would know by
morning.</p>

<p>Johnny went back to the store to eat supper with the trader and to spend
the evening in his company. Just before he reached the post he came face
to face with Charlie Paul, Kent’s teamster.</p>

<p>The Indian had come to the Reservation from the ranch, a distance of
sixty miles, in less than four hours. A fair bit of riding when one
considers the country over which he traveled. The effort left the man
calm, unhurried. He had stolen away and surmised that he came on an
urgent errand, but no trace of excitement was on his face.</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>Molly had appeared soon after Gallup’s departure, and upon asking for
her pony, had been told that she was not to leave the house. Angry words
followed, and Molly, defying the old man, had set off at a brisk walk
for the hills.</p>

<p>Kent called to Madeiras to follow her and keep her in sight until she
came home. The command to the Basque was enough to dissuade the girl.
She preferred being locked in her room to being spied upon by Madeiras.
Later she became aware of the Basque’s presence on the porch outside her
window. Kent worked in his office, door open. Molly saw that she was a
prisoner. And why a prisoner unless she was to be forced to marry
Gallup?</p>

<p>This very day Molly had denied that she loved Johnny, but it was of him
that she thought now. If any one could save her, he could. If she could
get word to him, he’d come.</p>

<p>It was the old man’s habit to fall asleep after dinner. The girl waited
and listened for the sound of his asthmatic snoring. She had penned a
note to Johnny. When she felt sure that the way to the rear of the house
was open to her she crept out and found Charlie Paul. Her instructions
to him were brief and without any definite destination. Johnny was
somewhere on the Reservation. Charlie Paul would know how to find him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Piute had streaked away from the Diamond-Bar. In
the eyes of the law he had stolen the horse which he rode; his job was
gone, and he was on the side of danger—all of this just to repay the
girl for the respect she had always shown him. Pretty good stuff, that,
for an Indian.</p>

<p>“Hello, you, Charlie Paul!” Johnny called.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul smiled. “How?” he grunted. “Me find you.”</p>

<p>“Find me? How come?”</p>

<p>Charlie grinned as he handed Molly’s letter to Johnny. He was an Indian,
but he knew a thing or two.</p>

<p>Johnny lost his happy-go-lucky air as he read the following brief note:</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Johnny</span>:</p>

<p>“I am a prisoner here at the ranch. Aaron Gallup came today. Father
insists that I marry him. The man is coming back tomorrow with a
minister.</p>

<p>“Madeiras is here, too, the traitor! If Charlie Paul finds you I know
you will come.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; font-variant:small-caps;'>“Molly.”</div>
</div>

<p>“Good boy, you, Charlie Paul,” Johnny said warmly, laying a hand upon
the Indian’s arm. “You savvy what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well me savvy.”</p>

<p>“Plenty fight comin’,” Johnny told him. “Shots, kill maybe—all right,
you?”</p>

<p>“All right, me,” Charlie said simply.</p>

<p>“You got rifle?” the boy asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Me got um. On North Fork.”</p>

<p>“Hide out, eh? Buried?”</p>

<p>“<i>Hé</i>,” Charlie laughed mockingly. “I find um.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Charlie Paul was no fool. White men were not taking away his
gun. He had it where he could reach it when needed.</p>

<p>“We go now?” the Indian asked.</p>

<p>“No, Charlie. Horse too tired. Picket the ponies. We eat and sleep.
Moonup we go. Save horses, keep him fresh. Breakfast time we come by
ranch. Ride like hell then. You savvy?”</p>

<p>“Me savvy.”</p>

<p>For the time being Johnny gave up any thought of old Thunder Bird or
Crosbie Traynor. He cursed aloud whenever he thought of Molly married to
Gallup. Well, it would never come to pass. Not if he had to kill the
man.</p>

<p>After sundown they rode to the trader’s store and bought supplies enough
to last them a week. Before twilight was over they were out of Elk
Valley and heading for the North Fork. Sunup found them hovering close
to the ranch. Rose Creek, a branch of the North Fork, flowed past the
house. As usual with desert creeks, its course was marked by a screening
of willows and buckthorn. In this cover Johnny left Charlie Paul with
their ponies and a led one which the Indian had obtained from the old
chief.</p>

<p>“A minute or two after the breakfast bells rings,” the boy told the
Indian, “I’m goin’ to crawl up to the house. You stay here. You keep me
in range. Some man may stop me. If I raise my hand—like this—you shoot.
Right?”</p>

<p>“<i>Bueno</i>,” Charlie answered. “Like that”—he imitated Johnny’s
signal—“and I shoot.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Chinese cook rang his gong and the men began
trooping from the bunkhouse for their morning meal. Johnny waited no
longer. On his hands and knees he began crawling through the sagebrush.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he had reached the front porch, the floor of which
was a good foot above the ground. Noiselessly he crept beneath it. From
this shelter he stuck out a long willow gad and began tapping on the
window of Molly’s room.</p>

<p>The girl had been awake most of the night, and it did not take long for
this repeated tapping to draw her attention.</p>

<p>“Johnny!” she gasped as she caught sight of the boy’s face protruding
from the space below the porch.</p>

<p>“Get dressed quickly!” he ordered. “Don’t take over ten minutes.”</p>

<p>And, turtle-like, Johnny drew in his head and left Molly to jump into
her clothes. She whistled to him softly when she was ready.</p>

<p>“Come through the window,” he bade her. A second later she stood on the
porch beside him.</p>

<p>“Charlie’s in the willows with horses,” he said tersely. “You streak it
now. I’ll stop them if they catch sight of you.”</p>

<p>Just a clasp of the hands and she was gone. She had covered more than
half of the distance to the creek before Johnny started to follow her.
He had not taken twenty steps when the front door flew open and Kent
dashed out, gun in hand.</p>

<p>“You freeze where you are or I’ll blow your head off!” the old man
roared.</p>

<p>Johnny tarried not, but sped away as Kent’s gun barked again and again.
Johnny turned and fired over his shoulder as he ran. Molly was at the
creek. A second or two ought to see her mounted. Dropping to his knees,
Johnny emptied his pistol at the house.</p>

<p>The firing had brought twenty men to the old man’s side. Johnny could
hear him yelling:</p>

<p>“He’s stealin’ my girl! Kill him! Kill him! The thief!”</p>

<p>The bullets began kicking up the dust at Johnny’s feet. He had to run
for it now.</p>

<p>“Let’s ride!” he cried as he made the trees. “They’re goin’ for their
horses. We won’t have five minutes’ start on ’em.”</p>

<p>The drumming of their ponies’ hoofs upon the hard-packed road told Kent
that they had got away.</p>

<p>“Where are we heading for?” Molly cried as they raced along.</p>

<p>“God knows!” Johnny called to her. “Idaho, maybe. To the North Fork
first, and then that old stage trail to Boise. I figured we could slip
away and cross the line on the run. Can’t do it now! There’s an old mine
tunnel near the trail where it drops down the Tuscaroras. We’ll hole up
there till night. Got food and water there.”</p>

<p>Molly was crying, even though she rode at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t let them take me back,” she begged.</p>

<p>“They won’t!” Johnny cried grimly. “You’ll never marry Aaron Gallup!
I’ll see to that.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Long before Johnny’s party made the hills they could see that they were
closely followed. The dust cloud in back of them came on apace. For an
hour the fugitives held their advantage. After that the pursuers’ fresh
horses began to gain.</p>

<p>“You think we make the mine?” Johnny cried to Charlie Paul.</p>

<p>Charlie weighed his answer before delivering it. “Mebbe, I guess we make
um.”</p>

<p>The Indian patted his rifle and pulled up his horse. Johnny nodded. In
another second they had left Charlie far behind. Johnny strained his
ears for sound of the Indian’s firing. It came, then, a quick
<i>rat-tat-tat-tat</i>! Other guns began to roar. The cañon which Johnny and
Molly were ascending began to echo and reëcho the shooting.</p>

<p>They kept on, Molly half mad, Johnny watching their horses. Some time
later Charlie Paul caught up with them, his horse dripping lather.</p>

<p>“We make um mine now,” he said with a grin.</p>

<p>They still had ten long, uphill miles ahead of them. Johnny began to
believe they would make it. But what about tonight? The horses they rode
would have to face the test again then. The boy knew they would never
meet it.</p>

<p>Better to drive them now to their last ounce of endurance and make sure
of temporary safety.</p>

<p>“Give ’em the spurs!” he cried. “Crowd ’em!”</p>

<p>With it all they were none too soon. Ten minutes after they had entered
the mine, their horses ahead of them, the posse swung around the bend
below.</p>

<p>“They can’t be dumb enough to miss us,” Johnny grumbled. “Some of them
may go by; but they’ll be back. We’ll fight it out here.”</p>

<p>Charlie and he crawled out upon the tailings from the mine, and there,
flat on their stomachs, they watched the men swarming below them.</p>

<p>“Spotted us first crack,” the boy said with a growl. “I knew it!
Couldn’t fool old Hobe. He savvies this country.”</p>

<p>“Me shoot now?” Charlie questioned.</p>

<p>“No, not now. By and by we shoot. They won’t smoke us out of here in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>Down below the men were spreading out fanwise. Johnny caught glimpses of
them as they moved from cover to cover. They had sent their horses down
the cañon.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul glanced at Johnny. He understood the movement below. The
pursuers were circling them. Being an Indian, Charlie knew that it was
very bad to wait for that circle to close. Death was usually the price
of it.</p>

<p>“No good wait,” he argued. “No use shoot bimeby.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em shoot first,” Johnny counseled. “They used to be my friends.
Reckon they ain’t now. When we shoot we’ll shoot to kill.”</p>

<p>Half an hour passed without a gun being fired. Johnny felt reasonably
safe. The mine was perched on the side of the mountain high above the
surrounding country. In front of the tunnel the ground fell away rapidly
to a small flat seventy-five yards below. Across this flat the attack
would eventually come.</p>

<p>Kent might surround the mountain and thus cut off his quarry’s escape,
but Johnny did not worry about being ambushed from behind. Only a
mountain sheep could climb up those walls of basalt.</p>

<p>Kent must have come to the same conclusion, for his forces began to
close in on the flat. Stuffy Tyler made it first. Johnny’s gun barked as
the man started to dash across the flat. Tyler crawled back to shelter
behind a bowlder.</p>

<p>“Next man who tries that gets killed,” Johnny yelled.</p>

<p>The word brought Molly to the boy’s side. He pulled her down. “Don’t
stand thata-way,” he warned her.</p>

<p>“Is there going to be killing here, Johnny?” Molly asked chokingly.</p>

<p>“Reckon there’s certain to be.”</p>

<p>“Father’s down there. I—I wouldn’t want him killed—”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to look out for himself,” Johnny said without a second’s
hesitancy. “It’s me or him. This thing goes through to a finish this
time. You go back in the tunnel a ways. There’ll be shootin’ directly.”</p>

<p>Dismissed, beside herself with worry and hopelessness, Molly crawled
back to safety. In her heart there was no malice toward Johnny. He was
in danger at her request. It made him the master. He was fighting for
her!</p>

<p>Her deductions were as primitive as a cave-woman’s. Likewise, they were
uncommonly sound.</p>

<p>Kent had his forces in position now, and from behind bowlders a half
dozen men dashed for the flat. Charlie Paul did not wait for Johnny’s
permission to fire. Johnny’s gun began flashing, too. Two men with arms
limp at their sides scurried back. Three others, uninjured, followed
them. One man—Stub Rawlings—lay face upward in the open, pawing the
ground with his legs, one of which had a hole shot through it.</p>

<p>“Better take care of him, Hobe,” Johnny cried. “Git him out of the way.
Just you alone does the job.”</p>

<p>Stalwart, unafraid, big Hobe walked into view.</p>

<p>“Good God, Johnny!” he shouted. “Are you crazy? I’d sure hate to shoot
you down; but I’m goin’ to if you don’t give in. What’re you goin’ to do
with that girl?”</p>

<p>“Marry her, if she’ll have me.”</p>

<p>The foreman swore a terrible oath. “You can’t steal a girl like that.”</p>

<p>“Hell I can’t!” Johnny roared. “She’s here, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Will you give up if we let you go?” Ferris demanded.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no givin’ up this time, Hobe. Don’t you be so sad about me.”</p>

<p>“You damn fool! You pore damn fool!” he repeated over and over again as
he went downhill, Stub in his arms.</p>

<p>There came another lull. And then reënforcements arrived for
Kent—Gallup, and no less a person than Jasper Roddy, the sheriff of
Shoshone County; and a man Johnny did not know, the Rev. Murray
Whitaker.</p>

<p>There was a prodigious amount of consultation soon after Gallup arrived.
The boy could see them surrounding Aaron’s rig. The upshot of it was the
ascent of the sheriff to the little flat.</p>

<p>“You hear me, there?” Roddy demanded.</p>

<p>“I hear you all right,” Johnny replied. “But I don’t like your voice.”</p>

<p>“You’re under arrest,” the sheriff bawled. “Shootin’ with intent to
kill, and five or six other things. I want that horse-stealin’ Injun
what’s with you, too.”</p>

<p>“I’d admire to see you git him,” Johnny laughed. “I always had a
hankerin’ to see just how yellow you was.”</p>

<p>“Well, you hear me. I’ve sworn in each one of these men as my deputies.
We’re goin’ to get you! You’re defyin’ the law now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you scare me thata-way,” Johnny answered sarcastically. “You’d
better stay in the rear of your deputies, Roddy, or this mountain will
be your monument, and it’d be a shame to waste one as big as this on
you.”</p>

<p>Roddy withdrew and appeared in no hurry to close in on his prisoners.
This Dice boy was thoroughly disconcerting.</p>

<p>Kent and Gallup tried to insist on storming the mine at once, but wily
Jasper Roddy could see no sense in wasting life when it would be
easier—and safer—to starve the fugitives into submission.</p>

<p>The morning passed without another shot being fired. The sun,
uncomfortably warm for October, began searching the lower cañon and
finally drove the posse into the shadow of a ledge which cut them off
from Johnny’s vision.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul and the boy dozed in turn as the afternoon wore on. Molly,
stoical now, boiled coffee and fried bacon for them.</p>

<p>They knew they were closely watched. The westering sun, glinting on
polished rifle barrels, betrayed the stalkers.</p>

<p>Evening came on, and with it the acrid smell of burning sagebrush as the
posse prepared its supper. The first thrill of the man hunt had worn
off, and Kent’s men were bad-tempered.</p>

<p>Madeiras was there, stretched out upon the ground, half asleep. Gallup
had been studying him for some time when the Basque, feeling the man’s
eyes on him, sat up and stared insolently at the coroner.</p>

<p>“Guess you ain’t sorry you’re down here,” Aaron growled.</p>

<p>“You bat my life on that,” Tony answered with a grin. “We catch those
fellow pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Catch ’em? Who wants to catch ’em? If Roddy had any guts he’d march up
there and shoot ’em down. Johnny Dice ain’t worth a cent to me alive.”</p>

<p>“He mak’ lot of trouble, heem.”</p>

<p>“You said it, Madeiras! He ain’t licked till he’s in the ground.”</p>

<p>“Johnny ain’t worth a cent to you alive; how much he worth daid,
<i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>Aaron’s head came up at that and he studied the Basque’s face without
answering. Then:</p>

<p>“What you drivin’ at?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe man get up those rocks in back of heem, eh?”</p>

<p>“You mean you?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe me,” Tony muttered.</p>

<p>“You show him to me, dead, and there’ll be plenty <i>dinero</i> for you,
Madeiras.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, I go to jail, too.”</p>

<p>“Not a chance. Roddy’s sworn you in. If that idiot resists arrest, blow
his head off and the law’ll back you up.”</p>

<p>Tony did not appear to view the prospect with any degree of faith.</p>

<p>“Law no good for Basque,” he stated. “Plenty Basque in jail.”</p>

<p>“Not if I’m for you,” argued Gallup.</p>

<p>“How I know you be for me?”</p>

<p>“I’m for you if you mean business. Why, here”—and Aaron drew from his
pocket a buckskin bag, and undoing the draw-string, held the purse out
to the Basque—“run your fingers through that! All gold, all twenties.
Five hundred. It’s yours if you go through with this.”</p>

<p>Tony sent his fingers deep into the bag. A crafty light came into
Gallup’s eyes as the man felt the precious metal. Tony’s face was
working strangely. The coroner thought he read greed—success for himself
in it.</p>

<p>But the Basque’s fingers were not caressing the gold pieces. They were
searching for something more precious than money.</p>

<p>For weeks he had been yearning to put his fingers in that very purse.
Why? A child’s whim. At least the reasoning behind the desire was no
more intelligent or logical than a child’s.</p>

<p>The swarthy-faced one’s teeth gleamed as he touched that mysterious
thing for which he searched. A thrill passed through his arm. He was
holding the gold snake Crosbie Traynor had worn on his hat band!</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Tony withdrew his hand.</p>

<p>“I do thees thing for you,” he muttered. “The boy ees young, he ees in
luff—the great passion ees on heem. Eet ees bad to keel a man, then.
You—you’re ole; luff ees not for you. But I do thees thing. I get up
there. You tell Kent to keep hees men from shoot me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ’tend to that,” Gallup said, excitedly, as he put away the purse.</p>

<p>“All right, I go; but thees purse, I tak’ heem now!”</p>

<p>It was on Aaron’s tongue to demur, to refuse point blank; but why be
cautious? He had gold pieces enough to fill many bags. What were five
hundred dollars weighed against Molly Kent? With Johnny Dice out of the
way the future was unclouded.</p>

<p>“Don’t you double-cross me,” Gallup warned as he passed the purse to the
Basque.</p>

<p>Tony did not even reply. He was gone before Aaron had caught his breath.
When he had control of himself he called to Kent and the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Madeiras has gone to bring them in,” he told them. “He’s goin’ up in
back of the mine. You pass the word that he’s not to be picked off from
below.”</p>

<p>“The skunk!” Hobe growled when Kent told him what was happening. “I
wouldn’t blame the boys if they did drill him. You know how they feel
toward him. Better not say anythin’ to them.”</p>

<p>It took the Basque more than an hour to get to the top. He made his
plans as he moved, and they were admirable. What Charlie Paul would do
was his one worry.</p>

<p>Molly was the first to become aware of Madeiras’ presence. He was
twenty-five yards above the mine at the time, wriggling along on his
stomach. The girl could not move for a second, and as she stood
dumfounded she saw Tony roll a small bit of rock in Johnny’s direction.
It caught the boy’s attention about the same instant that he saw the
girl’s signals. Charlie Paul had swung his rifle around so that it
covered the Basque. Johnny knocked it down.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot,” he warned. “The Basque’s all right.”</p>

<p>“All right?” Molly questioned. “Didn’t he turn his back on you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand. He went to the ranch on my say-so.”</p>

<p>With his hand the boy beckoned to Madeiras to come down. “Keep low when
you cross the tailin’s,” Johnny told him. “They’ll git you from below if
you ain’t careful.”</p>

<p>The boy thought, of course, that Tony had stolen away from Kent’s camp
to make his stand with the three of them. He knew he would have done the
same thing had the tables been turned.</p>

<p>Imagine his surprise when he saw the Basque kick the Indian’s rifle over
the edge of the dump and heard himself ordered to throw up his hands.</p>

<p>The order was heard down below. Men were watching. The Basque made no
effort to keep out of sight.</p>

<p>Molly moaned as she saw how Johnny had been fooled by the treacherous
Madeiras. Charlie Paul was crawling after his gun. Johnny for once in
his life was speechless. He tried to lift his arms, but his muscles
would not obey.</p>

<p>The Basque’s gun was not more than three feet from Johnny’s head. The
two men were permitted a second in which to stare into each other’s
eyes.</p>

<p>The Basque said something. What was it? Madeiras was moving his lips. He
was whispering to him, but so low that Molly, even as close as she was,
did not hear. Johnny caught the words then. It was a command!</p>

<p>The next instant the Basque’s gun roared. Johnny’s arms went up
convulsively. His body whirled, seemed to lose its balance, and for a
second swayed crazily over the edge of the dump. Molly screamed and ran
to catch him, but the boy was gone. She could see him careening down the
tailings, a trail of blood in his wake.</p>

<p>The weight of Johnny’s body set the loose rock in motion. His fall had
sent a small avalanche ahead of him, and now he rode upon a moving sea
of quartz and feldspar.</p>

<p>The direction in which the rock was falling was away from the men below.
Molly saw the almost impenetrable cañon toward which the body was
dashing. She closed her eyes and turned away. But she could not shut
from her ears the roaring of that grinding, splintering mass of rock.</p>

<p>Clouds of dust arose and hung over the lower cañon long after the noise
had ceased.</p>

<p>Madeiras climbed out to the edge of the dump. It was twilight, but he
could see the men below. They were running about, shouting, and waving
their arms. Gallup and Kent and the sheriff were bunched together. The
Basque shook his fist at them.</p>

<p>“There he ees, Gallup,” he shouted. “You can come and get heem now!”</p>

</h2>

<p>“Git him?” the crowd yelled. “We’ll git you, you bosco—you white-livered
whelp—you low-down, ornery—”</p>

<p>And they meant it, too!</p>

<p>“Git your rope, Stuffy,” some one cried. “We’ll give that hombre a
ride.”</p>

<p>Gallup and Kent glanced at Hobe. The big foreman’s face was black with
hatred. “Come on,” they heard him grumble; “we’re goin’ up there.”</p>

<p>“He only did what he was told to do,” the sheriff hurried to explain. “I
swore him in. He’s within the law.”</p>

<p>“Law?” Hobe’s jaw looked dangerous. “Ain’t no law that’ll let a man
murder his pal. To hell with your law! We’re goin’ to git him!”</p>

<p>Roddy’s face paled at the crowd’s answer to this statement. Kent,
however, was less frightened.</p>

<p>“I’m tellin’ you, boys,” the old man cried. “Ain’t no man workin’ for me
that touches that Basque. I wanted my girl. He got her for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m tellin’ you, Kent,” Hobe ground out, “it’s either me or the
Basque. We don’t ride the same range after this.”</p>

<p>There wasn’t even the smallest bit of bluff about this. Kent realized
it, too. He could ill afford to lose Hobe. “The Basque’ll go, then,” he
said grudgingly, “but I’ll not see him hung.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think he’d do to the girl if the crowd of you started
up there?” Roddy inquired. “If he’s what you think he is, he’d fix her.”</p>

<p>“Let all of you stay back,” Kent cried, elbowing his way to Gallup’s
side. “The two of us will go up. I want my girl, and I’ll git her
unharmed. What Roddy says is so. You’re only makin’ a damned nuisance
out of yourself with this talk of hangin’. Come on, Gallup!”</p>

<p>For a moment Kent was master. He was again the tyrant of bygone days.</p>

<p>Madeiras was keenly alive to his danger. He had sent Charlie Paul on his
way; Molly was heaping coals of fire upon the Basque’s head, but the
thing which held Tony’s attention was that angry murmur from below. He
recognized the sounds. He had seen men hanged!</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief he saw Gallup and Kent break from the crowd and
start toward him. When they reached the upper side of the little flat
the Basque called to them:</p>

<p>“You drop those gun before you come any closer!”</p>

<p>“I want my daughter!” Kent answered.</p>

<p>“Thass always right wit’ me, <i>señor</i>; but those gun—they stay behin’.”</p>

<p>“Humor the fool,” Gallup cried, throwing his rifle into the sage. “We
want the girl, and I want to see Dice’s body.”</p>

<p>Unarmed, therefore, they climbed to the entrance of the mine. Madeiras
met them with a surly laugh.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” Kent demanded.</p>

<p>Tony pointed to a pile of blankets upon which Molly lay sobbing. Kent
knelt beside her, his bony fingers shaking as he caressed her hair.</p>

<p>“Come, Molly,” he begged, “we’ll git you home.”</p>

<p>Molly turned from him angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” she cried. “Your hands are as red as that beast’s
there. I didn’t believe you could stoop to this.”</p>

<p>“Now, now,” Kent pleaded, “you’re all upset. I’ll——”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing for me!” Molly raised her hand and pointed at Gallup.
“You two men may take me away from here; you may make me go to the
ranch, and even marry me off; but you’ll do it by force! Father—I think
I despise you. I see now why you got Madeiras to come back. It was
nicely worked out. Well, I know where I stand. I’m no longer the fool.”</p>

<p>The girl was hysterical. The old man thought she would fall, so
helplessly did she sway from side to side.</p>

<p>“My own father—my own flesh and blood,” she sobbed. “That you could do
this to me.” And with a lunge she threw herself toward the edge of the
dump over which Johnny had pitched.</p>

<p>Kent caught her and drew her back, a dead weight in his arms.</p>

<p>“She’s fainted,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Won’t hurt her,” Gallup assured him. “Here’s horses; git her down to my
rig and take her home. Put her to bed and see that she don’t try nothin’
foolish. I’m goin’ down there.” And he pointed to the spot where he
expected to find Johnny’s body. “You come along, Madeiras. We can git
down there if we take our time.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí, I</i> go; but I go alone. <i>Señor</i>, you are the coroner, not the
sheriff. Why should I go weeth you?”</p>

<p>“You know why,” Aaron growled.</p>

<p>“I know no such theeng,” Tony argued. “You geeve me five hundret dollar.
I keel him like I promise. You ought be satisfied.”</p>

<p>Kent’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>“You paid him to kill the boy?” the old man asked Aaron.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Gallup. “We’re done with him. I want to see just how
damn dead he is, though. Come on, Madeiras; you can’t afford to break
with me.”</p>

<p>Tony laughed softly to himself. When Kent started downhill with Molly
the Basque motioned to Gallup, and they set off, too. Tony’s heart was
heavy. He had overplayed his hand.</p>

<p>The long Nevada twilight was almost over by the time the two men reached
the bottom of the little side cañon into which Johnny’s body had shot.</p>

<p>“Here’s the place,” Gallup called. “Tons of rock came down. I don’t see
him, do you? Look around.”</p>

<p>They searched for fifteen minutes—time enough, considering the
place—without finding the body. Madeiras was wildly excited over this.
“Mebbe those rock cover heem up, eh?” he suggested, white-lipped.</p>

<p>“Naw! Wasn’t he ridin’ on top of them?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí!</i> But plenty rock come after him. No blood, no not’ing, here. When
the moon come up I deeg in these rock.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? If he’s buried, he’s dead enough. You can stay here if
you want to; I’m goin’ back. And I’ll trouble you to return that five
hundred. I ain’t payin’ for a dead man unless I see the body.”</p>

<p>“Thass so, <i>señor</i>?” the Basque inquired unpleasantly. He paused, then:
“Thees place plenty beeg enough for two daid man.”</p>

<p>He tossed his rifle in back of him, and with hands resting upon his
hips, he faced Gallup.</p>

<p>Aaron felt a shiver pass through his body. The size of those hands froze
his blood. He fancied he could feel them at his throat—tearing,
strangling, forcing the breath from his old carcass.</p>

<p>Gallup’s cunning did not fail him. He knew that the present was the time
for quick thinking and smooth talking.</p>

<p>“Why are you so down on me?” he asked, apparently going off at a
tangent.</p>

<p>“You ask that, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>Madeiras’ teeth showed white and even in the half light.</p>

<p>“That mortgage, eh? We can adjust that. Things can be arranged. Tobias
oversteps himself now and then. But give me a little time; I’ll fix that
up. And now about the five hundred—you keep it. You’ll be goin’ away,
and you’ll be needin’ money.” Aaron rubbed his hands. “Yes,” he
repeated, “you keep that money, Tony.”</p>

<p>“No, <i>señor</i>,” Tony said lightly. “You have made leetla mistak’. You
tak’ those money back. But you owe me somet’ing, of course. I keep
<i>thees</i>.”</p>

<p>Madeiras had been running his fingers through the contents of Gallup’s
purse and now held out for Aaron’s inspection the little gold snake
Crosbie Traynor had worn on his hat band.</p>

<p>Gallup shrank back, his jaws working nervously. The next second he was
reaching for the little charm.</p>

<p>“No, <i>señor</i>,” Tony warned. “I keep eet.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was in there,” Gallup shrieked. “It’s mine! What in
hell do you want with it?”</p>

<p>“Thass fonny t’ing why I want heem, <i>señor</i>. But since first time I see
those leetla snake I t’ink mebbe I lak’ to wear heem on my hat ban’ some
time.”</p>

<p>“What’re you talkin’ about? I’ve owned that luck piece these forty
years. Who’d you ever see wearin’ it?”</p>

<p>Tony grinned again.</p>

<p>“Mebbe those man what brought eet back to you, <i>señor</i>. He say the man
what own eet be sure recognize heem by that snake.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? What—what man?” Aaron babbled.</p>

<p>“Those man what keel himself, <i>señor</i>. Johnny Dice mebbe dead; but
me—Tony Madeiras—ees steel here! You go now.”</p>

<p>Aaron was in no position to dispute this.</p>

<p>Bent over, muttering strange words to himself, Gallup moved away, in his
ears the mocking laughter of the Basque.</p>

<p>Tony kept his word with Johnny. As soon as the moon came up he set the
débris in motion again. Tons and tons of small rock cascaded down upon
the mass already piled in the choked cañon, but it failed to uncover the
body of the boy.</p>

<p>It occurred to Madeiras, then, that Johnny might have crawled away some
distance and be lying helpless further down the cañon. He called for the
better part of ten minutes, but received no answer.</p>

<p>Johnny Dice was not to be found.</p>

<p>Hours later Gallup stumbled into Kent’s camp. Only Roddy and Tobias and
one or two others remained.</p>

<p>“You look as though you’d seen a ghost,” the sheriff remarked. “What in
God’s name you been up to?”</p>

<p>“Terrible trip,” Gallup moaned. “Too much for me.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you goin’ to hold an inquest?”</p>

<p>“Inquest, hell!” Aaron snorted. “The man’s buried under a hundred ton of
rock. The Basque was your deputy. That ends it as far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXI' title='XXI: TWO DEAD MEN'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>TWO DEAD MEN</span>
</h2>

<p>For a dead man Johnny Dice was most active at that very moment. He was
some five miles from the spot where Tony searched for his body. He was
not alone. Some one else moved through the greasewood and sage ahead of
him. Stealthily, too, Johnny felt. The two of them had been circling
each other for some time. Both were anxious to avoid the other, but for
this very reason, seemingly, their trails kept on crossing and
recrossing.</p>

<p>It was uncanny. Johnny thought he was being tracked. By innumerable
little deductions he knew that no animal made those sounds which
alternately retreated and advanced behind and before him. It was a man!
Who? The boy strained his eyes to catch sight of moving shadow or
strange object.</p>

<p>He went unrewarded. It may have been that he was less cautious than
usual. His mind was still blurred from the Basque’s shot. From the time
Madeiras had appeared upon the tailings until the present moment, things
had happened so quickly that Johnny could only grasp the essential
facts.</p>

<p>The boy knew that Tony had whispered: “Play dead!” The Basque’s every
movement had been made to the gallery. The next instant his gun had
flashed fire. Johnny’s fall had not been acted. Madeiras had given him
only a scalp wound, but the impact had been sufficient to send the boy
off his balance. The ride down the moving tailings had torn Johnny’s
clothing to shreds, but had not so much as scratched his skin. The stunt
under other circumstances would have been good sport.</p>

<p>He had regained consciousness there in the choked cañon. The Basque’s
words had come back to him: “Play dead!”</p>

<p>His wound, a trivial injury, had confirmed his faith in the fact that
the shooting was a game. Madeiras was too handy with a gun to have
missed at that distance! Something had happened at the ranch—something
which would be uncovered if certain parties thought him dead. It was
plain enough to Johnny.</p>

<p>Feeling certain that soon some one would be searching for him, the boy
had crawled over the loose rock and made his way down the cañon to where
it opened on a high plateau.</p>

<p>There he had rested—and worried about Molly. What was to stop Gallup
from marrying her now? Could he depend on Tony to prevent that? Surely
the Basque would not have gone to this desperate measure unless he was
prepared to protect the girl. The boy had to stand on something, and he
chose to do it on this hypothesis. A sensible decision.</p>

<p>But Johnny proceeded to make a bad mistake. Believing as he did that
Tony wanted the world to consider him dead he hoped to better accomplish
the hoax by hiding from the Basque; never for a moment realizing that
Madeiras on not finding the body would jump to the conclusion that
Johnny was buried under the avalanche of rock.</p>

<p>The boy’s first need was a horse. Being afoot in this country rendered
him almost helpless. Kent and his men would surely be watching for him,
so Johnny had headed for the Reservation as his best refuge.</p>

<p>Half an hour back his trail had crossed that of the man out there in the
blackness. It had stopped any further thought of Molly and Madeiras.</p>

<p>And now a very curious thing happened. A thud and the sound of crackling
brush to his right made Johnny turn in that direction. As he did so some
one whispered in back of him:</p>

<p>“Hands up!”</p>

<p>The other man had tossed a rock into the sage and the noise it made as
it landed had claimed the boy’s attention and left him an easy target.</p>

<p>“You turn him around now,” the voice said.</p>

<p>Johnny did as he was bid and found himself staring at Charlie Paul. The
Indian’s eyes bulged. “You him, Johnny?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Charlie Paul! You damn near scairt me to death.”</p>

<p>“You no dead?” the Indian asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Charlie. What happened?”</p>

<p>It took the Indian some time to satisfy the boy’s curiosity.</p>

<p>“Gallup and Kent go ’way, eh?” Johnny questioned. “You sure?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Take horses, too. I watch; I see. All gone now.”</p>

<p>Johnny pondered for some minutes over the Indian’s information.</p>

<p>“Charlie Paul,” he said at last. “I tell you somethin’. You try
understand him, Charlie. Savvy?”</p>

<p>Charlie grunted his assent.</p>

<p>“Well,” the boy began, “everybody think I’m dead—me. You no tell. The
Basque, he good friend me. He not shoot for kill. Me and him play game,
all same like <i>viente y uno</i>, you savvy? So! By and by I catch him man.”
Johnny indicated a rope around his neck. “You no talk, eh?”</p>

<p>“No talk, me.”</p>

<p>“Good. I go back on mine. Plenty grub, plenty water there. You take him
money. Mebbe you go Reservation; buy two horse. No tell Thunder Bird you
buy him for me. You do that, Charlie Paul?”</p>

<p>“I go,” said the Indian. “Mebbe so tomorrow night I be back.”</p>

<p>Sundown the following day found Charlie back at the mine. Johnny had
slept for hours, and soon after the Indian’s arrival he determined to
ride to the Diamond-Bar and let Molly know that he was not dead. He
could depend on her to keep his secret. To withhold the truth from her
was needless cruelty.</p>

<p>Johnny circled the house before he approached it. A dim light burned in
Molly’s room. Crawling to the side window he lay upon the ground
listening for some sound which would tell him she was awake. Once or
twice he fancied he heard a low sob or moan. Getting to his feet he
fastened his hands on the sill above him and began drawing up his body
so that he could see into the room.</p>

<p>His head and shoulders were even with the bottom of the window when a
nail tore into his forearm. The pain of it forced a moan from his lips.
It had a startling effect on the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Molly was in bed; but not asleep. Old Kent sat beside her. Neither had
been aware of the boy’s nearness until that mournful cry escaped his
lips. They turned, mouths open, eyes wide.</p>

<p>The old man screamed as he saw Johnny. Pain and the dead weight of his
body upon his arms had put a hideous expression on the boy’s face. His
clothes were ragged, his face white, his hair uncombed. The dim light
threw shadows which only magnified his weirdness.</p>

<p>“Take him away! Take him away!” Kent screeched. “Don’t you see him?” he
wailed. “He’s there—in the window. Aw-w-w!” And he covered his face with
his hands to shut out the gruesome sight.</p>

<p>Without knowing that he did it, Johnny flung a beseeching hand toward
Molly. A shriek answered him and he saw her topple over upon her bed.
The men were running from the bunk-house. There was nothing left for the
boy to do but go.</p>

<p>From the cover of the willows by the creek he could see men moving about
with lanterns. Cries came to him, and above others, the sound of Kent
yelling:</p>

<p>“A ghost, I tell yuh! He’s come back to haunt me! Don’t laugh at me!
Don’t laugh!” And Kent’s cry rose until it broke in a fit of choking.</p>

<p>“Take him inside,” came an order in Hobe’s voice. “He’s babblin’ like a
child.”</p>

<p>The old man fought them off as they tried to lift him.</p>

<p>“He’s here!” he cried. “I heard him! Don’t let him git me. Molly, Molly,
I didn’t do it. Gallup paid Madeiras to kill him. I swear I didn’t do
it. I swear——”</p>

<p>The old man’s cries died away in a moan of anguish. The door banged and
Johnny knew that they had taken him to his room.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out on Johnny. It had never occurred to him that this
construction would be put on his appearance. Was it possible that this
was the very thing Tony had had in mind when he shot him? The sight of
him had frightened Kent out of his wits.</p>

<p>What would happen if he appeared before Gallup in the dead of night in
similar fashion? Gallup had paid Madeiras to murder him.</p>

<p>Johnny cursed Gallup as he led his horse away from the ranch.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll pay you a visit, Aaron,” he said to himself. “And right
soon, too. I may be dead, but I’ll put the fear of hell into your
miserable old carcass. You’ll be thinkin’ of somethin’ else besides who
you are goin’ to marry.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s one brief glance at Molly had shown him the girl tired,
grief-stricken, hysterical. He wanted to tell her, now more than ever,
that he lived; but to do so meant the loss of his best weapon against
Kent and Gallup. Better for her to suffer now than to be forced into
marrying Aaron Gallup.</p>

<p>Thoughts of Crosbie Traynor came to Johnny as he rode along. What had
old Thunder Bird found out? The chief would have something to say when
next they met.</p>

<p>“Strikes me we got quite a lot in common, Crosbie Traynor,” mused
Johnny. “The world’s got both of us figured for dead. Only I’m alive to
avenge myself.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE FACE IN THE WINDOW</span>
</h2>

<p>Johnny surprised Charlie Paul on the following day by telling him that
they were going to Standing Rock.</p>

<p>“Me still dead man,” the boy said in answer to the question in the
Indian’s eyes. “We stop this side the Rock. Nobody there know I be in
your camp. Mebbe so, come night time, we go into town, play ghost, mebbe
scare some man, eh?”</p>

<p>Charlie grinned and shook his head. “Ah, nah,” he said, “me no ghost.”</p>

<p>“I be the ghost, Charlie,” Johnny told him. “Gallup paid Tony to git me.
I’m goin’ to play dead now. You go down and git the horses. I be ready
pretty quick.”</p>

<p>This talk of ghosts was “bad medicine” in Charlie’s eyes, but he agreed,
nevertheless, to do as the boy ordered.</p>

<p>The two traveled far from any road, and so slow was their progress that
night found them still some miles from town.</p>

<p>Low hills came close to the northern limits of Standing Rock. The Indian
knew a spot among them where he decided to camp. It was a little after
nine o’clock before they reached it.</p>

<p>“Leave our stuff here, Charlie,” Johnny advised. “We eat, then we go see
Gallup.”</p>

<p>The Indian answered with a shrug of his shoulders. He favored more
direct action than this business of playing ghost. His way, under the
circumstances, would have been to pot Aaron as he slept.</p>

<p>Johnny thumbled his gun just as they were ready to leave. Charlie smiled
at this. Maybe the night held something of interest, after all.</p>

<p>“Ghost no have gun,” he laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“No,” Johnny chuckled. “All the same I take him. You watch sharp till we
cross railroad.”</p>

<p>He knew that once across the tracks they would be in little danger of
being seen. Gallup’s house was one of the few on that side of the Espee
main line.</p>

<p>When they had left the railroad a hundred yards behind they dismounted
and began walking through the sage toward Aaron’s place. The three or
four cabins they had to pass to get there were in darkness. A light
burned in an upper window of Gallup’s house.</p>

<p>“Tobias and him countin’ up the day’s profits, no doubt,” Johnny
thought. The Indian heard the boy muttering. “’Bout time I begun doin’ a
little countin’ up myself,” Johnny went on. Aloud, then, to Charlie he
said:</p>

<p>“You git ahead now. No noise, no tracks, you savvy?”</p>

<p>Again the Indian answered with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>In ten minutes they were lurking in the shadows beneath the lighted
window.</p>

<p>Aaron’s house was a story and a half affair, and the lighted window at
least ten feet from the ground. They could hear the murmur of voices,
but the closed window kept them from understanding a word of what was
being said.</p>

<p>A stone’s throw away the lights of the Palace Hotel burned brightly;
Johnny turned a wistful eye toward it. In a way it was his Times
Square—his Broadway. He wondered who was facing Scanlon tonight.
Something whispered to him that his evenings there were a thing of the
past. Gambling with him had been an art, but it was a sorry
accomplishment, one that would be of doubtful value to him in the days
to come.</p>

<p>Unknown to Johnny, this reasoning was based on the fact that
subconsciously he saw himself treading the future at Molly Kent’s side.</p>

<p>A through freight thundered by as the two men waited, undecided as to
their next move. Charlie looked blankly at the boy. “How you get up
there?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” Johnny answered, an idea breaking in on him. “I stand
on your shoulders, Charlie, you know, like this”—the boy stooped and
then arose, clasping the legs of an imaginary man. “You understand?”</p>

<p>Again that unemotional nod from the Indian. Getting down upon all fours,
he waited for Johnny to climb into position. The boy straightened up,
using the side of the house to help him retain his balance.</p>

<p>“Move along,” he whispered. “Stop when I signal.”</p>

<p>They had only ten feet to go. Charlie felt Johnny’s legs stiffen as the
boy came abreast the window. The Indian stopped.</p>

<p>“Steady,” Johnny warned as he pressed his face to the glass. He started
as he beheld Gallup’s companion. It was Tony Madeiras!</p>

<p>The Basque seemed to be having the best of the conversation. Tony had
his hat on, pushed back from his forehead, his black hair curling out
from beneath the brim. Something strange about the hat caught and held
Johnny’s attention. It was the little gold snake snapped in the hat
band.</p>

<p>“Traynor’s luck piece or I’m a liar,” Johnny gasped to himself. “Where
in God’s name did the Basque git it?”</p>

<p>He could see that Tony was enjoying himself. He knew Madeiras’ manner
when things were going his way. A smile all insolence wreathed the man’s
face. His eyes were contemplative, cruel. Gallup cowered before them.</p>

<p>There was money upon the table between the two men. The Basque pushed
the gold pieces to the floor with a sweep of his hand.</p>

<p>“Money mean not’ing to Tony Madeiras,” Johnny heard him say. “Thass
leetla theeng—money. You tell me ’bout those jail at Carson. Ha, ha!
Those jail be nice place for you, too, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Madeiras,” old Aaron whined. “You can’t send me down
there without goin’ yourself.”</p>

<p>“I go eef I have to. I’m strong; jail ees no nice place for old man like
you. Me, I do not try to keel Johnny. I just crease him, I t’ink. Those
rock, they keel him; but judge, he say we keel him just the same, I
guess. Now what you say—you steel try marry those girl?”</p>

<p>Aaron did not answer.</p>

<p>“As sure you try those trick,” Tony went on, “I go see the Señor
Kelsey”—the district attorney.</p>

<p>“You will, eh?” Gallup cried. “Like hell you will!”</p>

<p>His hand came up from under the table, a pistol, black and ominous, held
rigidly. “You’ll tell nothin’!” he screamed as he leveled his gun at the
Basque’s head.</p>

<p>A blood-curdling yell broke from Johnny’s lips as he saw the old man’s
finger tighten on the trigger. Gallup jumped. His chair crashed over as
he kicked it out of his way. The Basque’s eyes rolled until their whites
showed.</p>

<p>What was that in the window—a dead man’s face?</p>

<p>“<i>Hola! Virgen santa!</i>” Madeiras shouted, and he made the sign of the
cross. “Johnny! Johnny Dice!”</p>

<p>Gallup’s palsied hand pointed his gun at the apparition. Johnny
contorted his face and laughed diabolically. The old man’s finger
pressed the trigger and shot the window pane to bits, but the boy was
gone. He had beaten the gun by an instant.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul had felt the boy’s legs stiffen. The next he knew Johnny
was on the ground beside him. A moment later they were lost in the
night.</p>

<p>When they found their ponies the boy permitted himself his first laugh.
“That yell of mine,” he said, “wasn’t in the play. No, sir! Madeiras was
up there. Gallup would have killed him in another second.”</p>

<p>“Good old Tony,” thought Johnny. Molly was safe! Madeiras was a hero. He
was making a Judas of himself for his pal’s sake.</p>

<p>“Guess we don’t go back there pretty soon, eh?” Charlie chuckled.</p>

<p>“Surest thing!” exclaimed Johnny. “I know now that he’ll scare. We have
plenty fun along that man, Charlie.”</p>

<p>Madeiras had discovered as much, too. Even seeing the ghost of Johnny
Dice had not robbed him of all sense. When Gallup turned back from the
shattered window he found himself looking into the Basque’s gun.</p>

<p>“I tak’ those peestol now, <i>señor</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Aaron was too dumfounded to object. “Did yuh see it?” he demanded. “It
was him!”</p>

<p>“<i>Madre de Dios!</i> Of course I see heem,” the Basque cried angrily. His
hands flashed out and caught Gallup. Lifting him off his feet he hurled
him across the room.</p>

<p>“I ought to keel you!” he growled.</p>

</h2>

<p>The following morning found Kent in Standing Rock closeted with Gallup.
Kent was a nervous wreck. Molly had refused to speak to him; his men
were sullen, aloof; Tobias had been back about the notes, and to top it
all the specter of Johnny Dice walked beside him wherever he went.</p>

<p>“You been seein’ ghosts, too?” Aaron asked.</p>

<p>“You know, then, eh?” old Jackson answered miserably. “I saw him as
plain as I’m seein’ you, Gallup. The girl did, too. I’ll never forget
how it moaned. I used to laugh at men who believed in haunts.” Kent
shook his head. “I’m past doin’ that now. When did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Last night. It was here—but it ain’t no haunt. It’s Dice himself! I
found footprints beneath the window this mornin’. Let him come ag’in. I
won’t miss him a second time.”</p>

<p>“You mean he’s alive—that he ain’t killed?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it! I knew you couldn’t figger him dead unless you’d seen
his body put in the ground. He’s fooled us all, even the Basque.
Madeiras was here last night threatenin’ me. Told me he’d put me in
Carson Penitentiary if I tried to marry Molly.”</p>

<p>“I was hopin’ you’d change your mind about that, Gallup. The girl’s half
mad.”</p>

<p>“Well, you weren’t able to do anythin’ for Tobias yesterday. I’ll wait
’till day after tomorrow. You pay the money or I take the girl. She
ain’t got no use for you, nohow. A man’s got to have a little backbone
if he wants to keep his head up with wimmen. As soon as she pulled
Traynor’s name on you, you wilted. I don’t know how much Dice knows, but
it’s too much. Madeiras is makin’ big talk, too. The damn bosco stole
that old Moqui charm of mine. He knew who had it, too.”</p>

<p>“What?” Kent’s mouth twitched. He shook his fist in Gallup’s face.
“How’d he know that?” he cried.</p>

<p>“That scares you, does it? Let him prove what he——” Gallup stopped
short, his eyes on the door to the adjoining room. He had seen it move!
He knew that he had closed it when Kent came in. Pushing his visitor out
of the way, Aaron made a leap for the door and threw it open. Tobias was
caught flat-footed.</p>

<p>Gallup grabbed the man by his coat and dragged him into the room.
“Eavesdroppin’, eh?” Aaron screamed. “I’ll teach you to spy on me.
You’re through—fired! You ain’t got a cent but what you got from me. You
pussyfootin’ swine, what were you hopin’ to hear! Take <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>Tobias Gale fairly bristled as he got up from the floor. So wrathful was
he that his little body trembled from head to foot. For years he had
suppressed his emotions, bridled his desires, made a machine of himself.
Gallup marveled as he gazed at him now.</p>

<p>“Let us be honest for once, Aaron Gallup,” Tobias said with fine
impudence. “When the pot calls the kettle black it’s time to tell the
truth. What I’ve got is mine. I earned it doing your dirty bidding.</p>

<p>“You’ll not kick me out. I’ve protected myself. Indeed I have. You’ll
find that out when you try to call in some of your loans. Humph! A swine
am I, eh? You are the swine, Aaron Gallup.</p>

<p>“I know why you wanted Johnny Dice put out of the way, and I know that
Crosbie Traynor didn’t kill himself. You know it, too! You’ll crawl to
me before I’ve finished. You just try to kick me out, to cheat me—and
I’ll tell what’s what.</p>

<p>“You’ve kicked and beat me for years. You thought I didn’t mind. Well,
I’ve made it my business to find out about you. You start your little
tricks, and Molly Kent will know, and Johnny Dice will know. I’ll talk
you so deep into jail that the Carson Penitentiary will crumble to ruins
before they let you out.”</p>

<p>Tobias hurled a chair from his path.</p>

<p>“Get out of my way!” he warned Gallup. “I’m leaving this house now
forever. When you’ve got something to say to me you can come to the
hotel and find me.”</p>

<p>And the slave marched out, the king at last!</p>

<p>Kent and Gallup sat and stared at each other for countless minutes.
Crushed, dumfounded, Kent reached for his hat finally and without a word
stumbled down the stairs to get into his rig and start for home.</p>

<p>Gallup seemed unaware of his going. Meal time came, but Aaron still sat
in his upstairs room, fixedly gazing into space. Some one knocked at his
door, but he heard it not. His brain refused to hold any thought other
than that Johnny Dice lived and would have the truth from Tobias.</p>

<p>Aaron’s gun lay upon the table before him. As he continued to sit in his
trancelike state the pistol began to claim his attention. In fact,
Gallup fancied it talking to him.</p>

<p>“You’ve lived by the gun,” the weapon seemed to say. “I’ve seen you
through every big crisis of your life. I do my work well when properly
handled. I stop babbling tongues; smother secrets; give the old the
strength of the young. I am your friend, Aaron Gallup. Men whom you have
trusted have failed you or else they have been clumsy, stupid—in me
alone can you place dependence.”</p>

<p>Yes, it was plain, Johnny Dice had to die. Tobias and Madeiras were
dangerous—they could be attended to later, but Johnny Dice’s end was
imperative. He had to go. But how? It had to be soon—before the boy
talked with the other two. That meant tonight! Johnny Dice would have to
die tonight!</p>

<p>Gallup began to shake off his lethargy. Between now and sundown he had
to be ready.</p>

<p>He went downstairs and puttered over his stove preparing food. Color
flowed back into his face as his brain began to function again. He
mumbled to himself as he settled on what he would do. Gallup’s vanity
took much pleasure from the proposed plan. It was simple, but ripe with
the native ingenuity which had brought Aaron across many a rough spot.</p>

<p>In brief, it was this: no one but Tobias Gale and Jackson Kent knew that
he had seen through Johnny’s game. The boy had first appeared to Kent
and then to him. That argued that Johnny would be hiding out—anxious to
keep alive the story of his death.</p>

<p>Last night the boy’s ghostly visit had been more than a success. Now, if
he, Gallup, spread the story of what he had seen—the grinning face, the
fiendish cry—wouldn’t word of his talking reach Johnny? The man must
have some confederate who would carry the tale.</p>

<p>But supposing that failed, if men heard the coroner talking of having
seen a ghost, and this very night that ghost should return and be
killed, and proved no ghost at all—well, wouldn’t that be alibi enough?
Yet the law couldn’t touch Gallup for that.</p>

<p>So, then, it got down to whether Johnny would return. Aaron was
satisfied to believe that he would, so between then and sunset he spread
his story up and down the main street of Standing Rock.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul, loafing in front of the Palace Hotel, heard it and carried
it to Johnny.</p>

<p>“He look sick, Gallup,” the Indian went on. “He pretty damn well scared,
him.”</p>

<p>“Guess Aaron knows haunts is hostile to him,” Johnny said more to
himself than to Charlie.</p>

<p>“Him—Gallup—have big fight, too,” the faithful Indian added.</p>

<p>“What fight? No savvy that, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Man, Gale—all bus’ up.”</p>

<p>“Split—all off, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Him split,” Charlie grinned. “Him, Gale, live um hotel.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” Johnny dropped the frying pan to better voice his
surprise. “Them two old junipers fallin’ out—now what do you know ’bout
that? You hear any more, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“Nah. Gale get horse, he drive away.”</p>

<p>“There’s a kittle of fish for you!” Johnny shook his head
uncomprehendingly. “I should admire to know what’s up. Mebbe so we find
out tonight.”</p>

<p>Unknown to Johnny, Tobias Gale had returned to Standing Rock shortly
after sundown. He had not been alone when he reached the outskirts of
the town. There he had stopped, and the man who occupied the rig with
him had stepped to the ground. Gale had driven on, and the other man,
after ten minutes, had started to walk the remaining distance into the
Rock.</p>

<p>Tobias made no effort to see him again, but he was apparently well
satisfied with his day’s work. The man with whom he had driven across
country that afternoon could be expected to furnish rare entertainment
for one Gallup.</p>

<p>Gale made some discreet, but futile, inquiries regarding the whereabouts
of Tony Madeiras and retired to his room. This was Gallup’s night, and
Tobias was in no way inclined to share the spotlight with him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXIV' title='XXIV: JOHNNY DICE COMES BACK TO LIFE'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>JOHNNY DICE COMES BACK TO LIFE</span>
</h2>

<p>When Aaron Gallup retired to his home at seven o’clock that evening he
knew that if Johnny Dice hovered in or near Standing Rock he had heard
by now the story of his—Gallup’s—supernatural visitor. Figuratively
speaking, Aaron patted himself on the back for having set his trap for
the smooth Johnny. The old man’s confidence in his scheme was such that
he even whistled snatches of an old tune popular in the days of the
Santa Fe Trail.</p>

<p>He finished his supper without lighting a lamp. Having eaten, he climbed
the stairs and made ready for the expected visitor. He saw to it that
his gun was in order; he lighted a lamp; he raised the curtains—it was
as if he were a stage manager preparing for the evening’s show.</p>

<p>When his old brain refused to suggest any additional bit of stagecraft,
Aaron took his seat. He had arranged the lamp so that he sat in shadow.
Four or five times he drew a bead upon an imaginary face in the
window—it made him smile. He was ready—he wouldn’t miss tonight.</p>

<p>It was too early for ghosts, so he half dozed in his chair. A clock
struck eight, but Aaron heard it not, nor did he catch the soft
<i>pad-pad</i> of naked feet ascending the stairs. Gallup was in a strange
world confronting a horde of Johnny Dices. He shot them down, one after
another, until his trigger finger grew tired.</p>

<p>Minutes slipped by as the old man sat lost in reverie, a smile of
satisfaction upon his face. The door had opened noiselessly, a bony hand
forcing it inward. The visitor squinted his eyes at Gallup and took a
step into the room, closing the door behind him as he did so. He stood
still, waiting for the other to catch sight of him.</p>

<p>Aaron became aware of the man’s presence by degrees. When he saw him and
recognition followed, he uttered no word of surprise or fear, but just
stared and stared at him. And eyes as cold as his own stared back at
him.</p>

<p>This specter out of the past was no ghost, and yet it well might have
been, for if, in appearance, there was ever a living dead man it was
this gaunt visitor.</p>

<p>Gallup’s thoughts were no longer on the window. Johnny Dice no longer
obsessed him. He knew there could be no connection between the boy and
this shriveled shadow of a man confronting him.</p>

<p>And yet there was, and not so remote at that. But Johnny knew nothing of
the man’s coming. The boy was playing a lone hand this night. He had
already circled Gallup’s house several times. That a light should be
burning in that same room again tonight looked suspicious to Johnny. It
said all too plainly that he was expected.</p>

<p>Well, it is a poor general who has only one plan of attack. Johnny
flattered himself that he was equal to this occasion.</p>

<p>The eastern freight had not pulled in yet. Two carloads of ore from the
Black Prince mine stood upon the side track. They would have to be
picked up and cut into the train. Very likely the freight would bring a
car of merchandise from San Francisco for the Rock. That would take more
time. Cars would be switched back and forth past the house. One should
be able to see into that lighted upper story room from the top of one of
those cars.</p>

<p>Gallup had not replaced the shattered glass as yet. With fair skill a
man should be able to flip a piece of cardboard into the room. Johnny
had such a thing to toss at Gallup’s feet—the picture of Molly which he
had found in Traynor’s wallet.</p>

<p>The boy had the best of reasons for doing this. Surely if Gallup did not
recognize the picture it would worry him sore just because he could not
place the child’s face. A picture, delivered as this one would be,
carried a message, a warning. And perhaps the man would fail to reason
that it had been tossed into the room from the top of a passing freight
car. If so, he would be at some pains to figure how it came there upon
his floor.</p>

<p>If the incident produced no other effect than this, Johnny told himself
he would be satisfied. It would be another straw added to Aaron’s load,
and to break and unnerve the man was Johnny’s game.</p>

<p>But he stood to win more than this. He had made Kent admit that he had
known Crosbie Traynor. If Gallup recognized that picture it was proof
enough that he, too, had known the man. Then, Johnny felt that he would
have discovered the reason for Kent’s subservience to Gallup.</p>

<p>As he walked the tracks to the head of the switch just this side of the
shipping pens he told himself that he could not lose. No matter how the
play went, he won.</p>

<p>The freight pulled in half an hour late, but Johnny’s calculation in
regard to the amount of work the train crew would have to do proved
correct. Swinging up to the top of one of the big box cars he stretched
himself flat and waited for the switching to begin. In a few minutes he
was rolling past Gallup’s house.</p>

<p>Rising to his knees, the picture in his hand, he peered into the lighted
room. What he saw there drove his plans far from his mind. In fact, so
great was Johnny’s surprise that he had trouble in retaining his balance
upon the moving car.</p>

<p>Gallup’s visitor was old Thunder Bird! Yes—and the old chief was bound
and gagged! Gallup sat before him. Another second and the scene was
whisked from Johnny’s vision.</p>

<p>Johnny’s breath came in gasps as he rode down the tracks. Some things
were plain now. It was Thunder Bird himself whom Traynor had gone to
see! Could there be any doubt of it? Gallup saw an enemy in the Indian.
Why? What better reason would he want than that Thunder Bird had known
Traynor, and that the old chief knew that he—Gallup—had known the man,
too?</p>

<p>People had called Traynor a stranger, but here were three men—Thunder
Bird, Kent, and Gallup—whose actions proved that they had known him.
There might be others—Tobias Gale, for instance—he was a mysterious sort
of person. Indeed, no stranger’s bullet had ended Traynor’s life.</p>

<p>Johnny fretted and fumed as the minutes passed while the car stood
still. It seemed that hours dragged by before the engine came back to
shunt the car down the tracks toward town. Finally it began to move. The
boy felt it take the switch just before it crossed the main street of
the town. By this he knew that the car was going on to the siding which
managed to squeeze past the side of the hotel.</p>

<p>Although not so close to Gallup’s house now, the boy could see into the
room by standing erect. The car came to a stop almost opposite it.
Johnny saw Thunder Bird tied in his chair, but Gallup was gone.
“Downstairs, no doubt,” mused Johnny, “lookin’ for me.”</p>

<p>For the ten minutes that the car stood on the siding Johnny stared into
the lighted room. He did not know just what to do. Rescuing men from
Gallup’s lair was hardly a thing to be pursued as a nightly
vocation—that is, if one were at all fond of living. But on the other
hand, Thunder Bird might hold the key to the entire situation. Johnny
felt that the old chief could explain many things if he could be induced
to talk.</p>

<p>Obviously the thing to do was to find Madeiras and then force a way into
Gallup’s house. Tony must be in town. Finding the Basque could not be
more than an hour’s work.</p>

<p>“Damn it,” Johnny muttered. “Wish I’d tipped him off to the truth.
Hain’t helped a bit to let him think he killed me. I sure need him now.
Charlie wouldn’t be no good at all. He’d want to stick a knife into
Gallup.”</p>

<p>The engine kicked a string of cars against the one upon which Johnny
stood. They hit so sharply that the boy’s legs almost went out from
under him. Crawling to the hand irons he swung his foot out to find the
top one. He was facing the hotel for the first time. Before him was the
room in which Traynor had been killed. Johnny drew back his foot, his
brain reeling as he began putting two and two together.</p>

<p>Once he stretched out his arm and touched the window sill.</p>

<p>“My God,” he moaned, “this is <i>it</i>! It couldn’t be anythin’ else. It was
this time of the night—the noise of the engine to kill the sound of the
shot, a stick to lift the man’s gun, a toss of the arm to throw it back
into the room after the killin’—it’s right as day! Why, of
course—Traynor’s hat was damp. It was rainin’ that night. When whoever
pulled it out to rip the band off, the rain got at it. And the wool—I
picked up a piece of fleece from the floor. Teixarra was shippin’ wool
that day. His cars stood right here. Mister, you’ve got the answer!”</p>

<p>Johnny mopped his face with his hands.</p>

<p>“Bumped him off with his own gun, too,” he muttered. “Right clever,
that. Yes, sir, this was one of the most clever murders this State can
boast of. I got to talk to somebody or bust. I’m goin’ to find
Madeiras.”</p>

<p>The car was moving away as Johnny swung to the ground. Half running, he
burst into the Palace barroom. Scanlon dropped his cards as he caught
sight of him.</p>

<p>Vinnie shouted: “My God, you dead, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Dead, hell!” Johnny roared. “Do I look like a dead one? Where’s
Madeiras?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t been here,” Scanlon answered.</p>

<p>“He was in town last night,” the boy exclaimed. “He ain’t far off right
now. If you see him tell him I’m lookin’ for him—to come on the run!”</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, Johnny flung himself through the door, deaf to the
questions in Scanlon’s eyes.</p>

<p>Vinnie stared at his partner. The other men present likewise looked at
one another. What had happened? Where had Johnny been? Gallup had seen
his ghost, eh? The laugh was on Aaron.</p>

<p>“He’s rearin’ right up for a ghost, ain’t he?” Scanlon declared.</p>

<p>“Sumthin’ goin’ to happen right soon, now,” somebody stated. “I ain’t
never seen Johnny so hostile.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” Scanlon muttered. “Trouble comin’—and Doc Ritter forty
miles away. They ain’t no advantages in this town!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>MADEIRAS ASSERTS HIMSELF</span>
</h2>

<p>Johnny combed the town without finding the Basque. No one would even
admit that they had seen him. The boy refused to give up. Madeiras was
there, somewhere, and he intended to find him. It was wasted effort,
Tony having left the Rock as Johnny crouched upon the freight car.</p>

<p>The day had been one of misery for the Basque. He believed that he had
killed Johnny. He was hardly less certain about having seen the boy’s
ghost. He was primitive and superstitious enough, too, to accept the
fact that a dead man’s spirit could return to haunt its enemies.</p>

<p>Tony had promised himself that Gallup should never get Molly. For this
reason he slept in Brackett’s stable. Aaron kept his rig there. If he
set out for the Diamond-Bar, Madeiras would know it.</p>

<p>The Basque, brooding all day long over Johnny’s death, found the fact
that he was keeping Gallup from Molly small recompense for the loss of
the body. More than once the Basque wished that he had killed the
coroner. He told himself that he would have to do it some day. Gallup
would have to pay his debt.</p>

<p>Tony had managed to secure more than enough to drink during the last day
or two. He had been half intoxicated when Gallup had entered the stables
an hour back and hitched up his team. Soon after the old man had left,
the Basque slid down from his nest in the hay mow.</p>

<p>“<i>Por Dios!</i>” he cursed. “So he go after all, eh? Better I tak’ her than
heem. I say, sometime I keel that man—tonight be the time!”</p>

<p>Madeiras had left his horse with an uncle at the <i>Casa Español</i>. The
animal was under lock and key when Tony got there. Half an hour was
wasted in awakening Felipe and unlocking the barn.</p>

<p>But at last the Basque set sail for the Diamond-Bar. He raked his pony
with the spurs as he urged him on. Gallup could not be far ahead. The
ride began to sober him and he wondered how Gallup had come so far.</p>

<p>Miles unwound until the Basque had covered half the distance to the
ranch. He had yet to catch a glimpse of Aaron. After another mile
Madeiras pulled up his horse.</p>

<p>“Where I mees that man?” he asked himself. “I come fas’—no team keep
ahead of me.” He snapped his fingers at a sudden thought. “Mebbe he
leave those team behin’ while I was’e all that time wit’ ole Felipe, and
some mens tak’ him in those dam’ flivver.”</p>

<p>Madeiras uttered a wild cry as he caught sight of the ranch. He was
breaking all records tonight.</p>

<p>Not until he was within a quarter of a mile of the house did he bring
his horse to a canter. A hundred yards more and he vaulted to the
ground. Gun in hand, he left the pony and went crawling away through the
sage. Passing to the rear of the house and finding the door unlocked, he
stepped inside.</p>

<p>Madeiras knew the place too well to need a guide to lead him to the
girl’s room. Not a light was burning. If Gallup had been here he was
gone now. The thought made the Basque less cautious. His spur chains
tinkled as he hurried to Molly’s door. It was locked. Molly heard him
tapping for admission.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she demanded, frightened.</p>

<p>“Quick!” Tony whispered. “It’s Madeiras. Gallup ees comin’ to tak’ you.
Open the door!”</p>

<p>“I will not!” came the girl’s voice, strong, defiant. “Go at once or
I’ll scream.”</p>

<p>“Scream!” the Basque dared her as he put his shoulder to the door and
snapped the lock. “You come wit’ me.”</p>

<p>A wave of emotion smote Madeiras as he sprang into the room. Molly had
lighted a lamp. He saw her crouching against the bed, her nightgown open
at the throat and half revealing the swelling bosom, the tapering limbs.
The fragrance of her pink and white loveliness intoxicated the Basque.
No wonder that Gallup wanted her. No wonder that Johnny had.</p>

<p>Molly had never been anything more than a tomboy to the Basque. He saw
her now for a flesh-and-blood goddess.</p>

<p>The girl read his look and opened her mouth to cry out. The Basque saw
her start and he leaped toward her. Molly struggled as his hand closed
over her mouth.</p>

<p>“Don’t you yell,” he warned her. “You t’ink I’m pretty bad frien’, eh?
Some day, mebbe, you change your min’. I tak’ you now. You go wit’ me!
What I care for Kent? What I care for Gallup? I keel my bes’ frien’; but
<i>Madre de Dios</i>, I die for you!”</p>

<p>Molly beat his hands and scratched his face, but a kitten would not have
been more helpless against the strength of him. She felt herself lifted
into his arms. With one hand Madeiras snatched up a pile of clothing.
The next instant he was striding down the hall, carrying her as if she
were no weight at all.</p>

<p>A hundred yards from the house the Basque turned, and shaking his fist
at it he cried:</p>

<p>“By God, for once Tony Madeiras ees the boss!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Old Aaron had no intention of going to the Diamond-Bar when he drove
away from Brackett’s stable. If the Basque had followed him for a block
of two he would have known as much because Gallup turned his team from
the main road and pulled up before his own house.</p>

<p>Johnny was standing in front of the hotel at the time and he promptly
surmised the reason for Aaron’s use of his team. The boy had about given
up any hope of finding Madeiras. The appearance of Gallup made him
decide to act alone.</p>

<p>“Sure as you’re born,” he said to himself, “that old crook is goin’ to
take Thunder Bird out in the brush and pump lead into him. I bet I’ll
have somethin’ to say about that.”</p>

<p>When Johnny crept around to the front of the house he saw that he was
not mistaken. The old chief, bound and gagged, sat disconsolately in the
rig. Aaron had gone back upstairs. The boy could hear him closing a
door.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I take it on the run,” Johnny told himself. A minute later
he was in the buckboard beside the Indian. Grabbing the reins and giving
the horses the gad took only a second.</p>

<p>When Gallup came out the team was gone. He cursed and ranted, but Johnny
and Thunder Bird were beyond the sound of his rage.</p>

<p>A mile out of town the boy brought the team to a halt. Thunder Bird’s
eyes expressed no surprise. When Johnny had untied him and removed the
gag from his mouth the chief made no attempt to speak.</p>

<p>“Men come soon, chief,” Johnny said, thoroughly provoked at the other’s
reticence. “You make talk pretty quick.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird shook his head slowly. “No talk, me,” he mumbled.</p>

<p>“No?” Johnny exclaimed hotly. “Mebbe so you change um mind. All the same
I not come, Gallup kill you.”</p>

<p>A sound, almost a laugh, broke from Thunder Bird’s lips. “I
think—me—mebbe so you come. I see you on top train.”</p>

<p>Johnny disregarded the Indian’s words.</p>

<p>“Chief,” he said, “many, many years you not come to white man’s town.
Why you come tonight?”</p>

<p>“No tell him that?”</p>

<p>“Gallup old friend with you, eh? You come, he tie you up—why you let him
do that?”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird’s chin was resting upon his chest. “<i>Huy!</i>” he grunted.
“Too old, me—too old.”</p>

<p>Johnny was not getting anywhere. “Chief,” he drawled, unpleasantly, “it
was you that Traynor came to see.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird turned his shrewd old eyes on the boy. “Mebbe,” he
answered.</p>

<p>It was admission enough.</p>

<p>“So,” Johnny continued, “you know who kill him, too, eh?”</p>

<p>The Indian did not answer at once. When he did, he surprised the boy.</p>

<p>“Mebbe me.” A soft, mocking laugh followed.</p>

<p>Johnny stared at him. “No,” he said at last. “No—no! He come on
Reservation—he come away from Reservation. You no kill him. White man
kill him.” Johnny tapped his chest. “Me, I know how”—pointing to the
chief—“you know why. Traynor no fool. He watch. Man catch him when he
sleep. If you not tell me his name, chief, easy me, I find out who brung
you to town. Mebbe that man talk. Lots of men talk by and by. You talk
now, eh?”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird shook his head determinedly. “No talk, me. You wait—two,
t’ree day you find out.”</p>

<p>It was an artful answer. Johnny understood the cunning insinuation it
carried. A muttered “Humph!” escaped him. “You mean, chief, that in two
or three days somebody’ll find a man with a bullet hole clean through
him or with a knife stuck in his back, and he’ll be the man that killed
Traynor. I savvy your talk, but it don’t go. Dead men don’t talk. No
talk, no good.”</p>

<p>“Man talk, jail catch um.”</p>

<p>This observation gave Johnny renewed hope. “You talk now,” he said, “law
catch um man, no catch um you. No talk now, mebbe so law catch um you by
and by.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird was unmoved. “No,” he murmured. “Law no catch um me. Law no
good for Indian—nothing no good for Indian. Piute make his own
medicine.”</p>

<p>“Sometime Piute medicine is bad. No good all time,” Johnny argued. “I
make good medicine for you, all the same you tell me.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird would not unbend. Again and again Johnny tried to make him
speak. The boy’s patience gave out in the end. He knew that in ten
minutes the old Indian could clear up the mystery of Traynor’s death if
he would. But, no; his dignity as a chief had been assailed, and Thunder
Bird was going to avenge the wrong in his own way. He couldn’t have said
it any plainer. And the prospective victim——Who else but old Aaron?</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of it. Johnny was satisfied that the chief was
pointing to Gallup as the murderer of Crosbie Traynor. But the Indian
had not made a single statement that could be used as evidence to
convict the coroner. His words were all innuendo. A man had to make his
own conclusions.</p>

<p>Johnny knew from experience that threats were idle with Thunder Bird. He
would talk when it pleased him to do so, and not before. Jumping to the
ground he said sharply:</p>

<p>“Chief, you take the team; you go Reservation. I watch Gallup. Best you
no come back. If you see Madeiras tell him I want him come quick. You
fan it now if you want to get back before daylight.”</p>

<p>Johnny trudged to town as the chief drove away. He felt defeated, held
off when success was almost within his grasp. Perhaps the wish was
father to the thought, but it was easy for him to believe that Gallup
had killed Traynor. He reconstructed the happenings of that tragic night
on which they had found the man’s body. He even recalled some of
Gallup’s conversation. Viewed, as the boy was doing now, it was
incriminating.</p>

<p>But what of Kent? The evidence had pointed to him from the start. There
were certain facts which were unalterable even now, but if Traynor had
been killed in the manner Johnny believed, Kent could not have done it.
Hobe had seen him playing cards with Doc Ritter at the very time the
crime must have been committed.</p>

<p>“And yet,” the boy thought, “Gallup’s got somethin’ on Kent. Absolutely
yes!—and he’s got him hard. Every guess I’ve got is weak some place,
even the one about the Indian. If the chief was Traynor’s friend, and
Traynor was tryin’ to square up an old debt, why did Thunder Bird let
the man come into the Rock? The Indian must have known that Kent was
shippin’ from here. And if he didn’t he knew damn well that Gallup was
here.</p>

<p>“Mebbe there was somebody else, too; but the chief would have knowed.
Ain’t likely he’d ’a’ sent a friend up against a stacked deck. And now
that old devil is out to git Gallup. Sure as he does I’m licked, I’m a
bust—a relic. On circumstantial evidence I could send two or three men
to jail, but on the real goods I couldn’t indict a jackass.”</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Johnny got back to the hotel. Scanlon’s game
was still active. Johnny recognized his fellow players—the two Faulkner
brothers and Tris Bowles. The Faulkners had been freighting supplies to
the Agency.</p>

<p>“Say, Charlie,” Johnny asked the elder of the two, “you didn’t come in
from the Valley today, did yuh?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Got in ’bout nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That so?” Johnny asked, better pleased with himself than he had been
for the last two hours. “Road’s pretty fair, I guess,” he ran on. “See
anybody?”</p>

<p>“No, not until we got just outside of town. That human grub worm, Tobias
Gale, passed us this side of the big hill.”</p>

<p>“Seein’ him wasn’t seein’ anybody.”</p>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments,” the younger Tris announced. “He’s got down to
doin’ Injuns out of their bit now. Had the old chief himself with him
today.”</p>

<p>Johnny Dice immediately lost all interest in the Messrs. Faulkner and
Bowles. Singling out Vinnie, he said to him:</p>

<p>“I got to wake up Tobias for a minute. We got some most important
business to transact. What room did you say he was in?”</p>

<p>“Now, Johnny,” Vin warned, “those man ees just come to leeve in thees
’otel. He’s goot pay. You mak’ no hell now.”</p>

<p>“Say, you quit scoldin’ me, Vinnie,” Johnny laughed. “You don’t know me;
I’ve reformed. Why the sound of a gun would frighten me to death.”</p>

<p>Vinnie grinned. Johnny Dice could have had the shirt from his back if he
had asked for it.</p>

<p>For all of his talk Johnny felt of his gun before he knocked on Tobias’
door. He got no answer, and after waiting a decent interval he tried the
door. It was unlocked. Stepping into the room he struck a match and held
it aloft.</p>

<p>“I’m damned,” he exclaimed. “He’s gone! What can that bird be up to this
time of the night? He’s strictly a to-bed-with-the-chickens sort of a
person. Went out the back way, too, or Vin would ’a’ seen him.”</p>

<p>Johnny was not long in deciding on what he would do. Going to the bed he
sat down and pulled off his boots.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to camp right here,” he said aloud. “When little Tobias comes
back we’re goin’ to make medicine.”</p>

</h2>

<p>The room was bathed in sunlight when Johnny Dice felt some one prodding
him back to consciousness. Vinnie the Basque stood over him, his eyes
wild with excitement.</p>

<p>“<i>Dios mio</i>, Johnny!” the man cried. “How you come here all night? What
you do weeth those man Gale?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” Johnny answered with a yawn. “Did I roost here all night?”</p>

<p>“How I know that? You come up here last night.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Gale wasn’t here. I took off my boots and lay down to wait for
him. Guess he didn’t come back.”</p>

<p>“You not hurt heem, eh?” Vin inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“’Course not. I’m too anxious to talk to him to hurt him.”</p>

<p>“Well, plenty trouble come now,” the Basque said sadly. “Roddy, Gallup,
and Kent ees just go ’way. They look for you. Sheriff, hee’s got warrant
for you, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“What?” Johnny pulled on his boots with a savage tug. “What’s he after
me for?”</p>

<p>“Kent say hees daughter ees gone; that you stole her.”</p>

<p>“For the love of God!” the boy cried, his face paling. “It’s a lie. I
was here at midnight. I couldn’t ’a’ got to the ranch and back since
then unless I’d had wings. Just what did Kent say?”</p>

<p>“Say the girl ees gone; room all mussed up; tracks outside the door.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it, Vin. It’s a trap to git me. If Molly’s gone, they
took her themselves. Where is Madeiras? I counted on him to look after
her.”</p>

<p>Vin shook his head as he saw Johnny lash himself into a rage.</p>

<p>“If Gallup is back of this I’ll bust him. Ain’t they tryin’ to find the
girl?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí!</i> Gallup say she be weeth you. Eef they fin’ you, they fin’ her.
They come here look for you. They try fin’ your horse, too. Horse ees
gone, so they think you gone.”</p>

<p>“Where they headin’ for?”</p>

<p>“Elk Valley. Those Faulkner boy say you ees ask las’ night ’bout the
road to the Reservation.”</p>

<p>“This gits pretty close to the showdown with me,” Johnny growled. “If
Roddy ever gits me I’m as good as dead. I’d just have to make a move to
have him shoot me down. ‘Tryin’ to git away’ would be his answer.
They’ll never take me. It’s a pretty mess they’ve cooked up, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, what you do now, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to do what I should ’a’ done two days ago—go to Jim Kelsey.
If there is any law in this county, he’s it. Vin, Charlie Paul is
campin’ at that spring beyond Stiles’s old place. He’s got my horse. Go
git him for me, will you. Tell him to wait in back of the hotel. I’ll
slip out that way now. No sense gittin’ you or Scanlon mixed up in
this.”</p>

<p>“I go myself,” Vin answered. He stopped at the door and seemed to
hesitate about saying what was on his mind. “Johnny,” he said haltingly,
“you hear all thees bad talk about Madeiras, yet you ask for heem. What
you theenk?”</p>

<p>“Say, Vin,” Johnny said warmly, “he’s my best friend. What he does is
done on my say-so. I don’t know where he is or what he is doin’, but
it’s right with me.”</p>

<p>Johnny could not have said anything which would have pleased the Basque
more. The pride of race was strong in Vin. His people had been fighting
from the day they landed for the respect of the native sons.</p>

<p>The boy waited until the Basque had gone before he moved. He knew that
he was face to face with trouble. Jim Kelsey held the decision. If what
Johnny had to tell him was convincing enough, the district attorney
could not refuse to act.</p>

<p>Gale’s mysterious absence also was of alarming importance. Having
brought Thunder Bird to face the coroner, it followed, as a matter of
course, that Tobias would endeavor to learn the outcome of that visit.</p>

<p>“He might ’a’ seen me drivin’ off with the old chief,” the boy thought.
“He stole out of the hotel just as I’m goin’ to do now. You can bet the
cautious Toby wasn’t headed for Aaron’s house.”</p>

<p>Johnny tried to catch sight of Gallup’s party as it rode out of town. To
see the better he opened the trapdoor which led to the roof of the hotel
and crawled out upon it. A mile away he could see four horsemen riding
into the north.</p>

<p>“A buckboard wasn’t fast enough for Gallup today, eh?” Johnny muttered.
“They’ll never git anywhere ridin’ that fast. Aaron’ll be so sore in an
hour or two that he’ll want to ride in a bed.”</p>

<p>Johnny crossed the roof to the side nearest the railroad tracks and
looked down on Gallup’s house.</p>

<p>“My Lord,” he said half aloud, “this would ’a’ been a grand-stand seat
for the doin’s last evenin’. If Toby had crawled up here he wouldn’t ’a’
missed a thing. And you can just bet your last cookie that that’s what
he did. He’s just about streakin’ it right now for the Reservation. Him
and the old chief are goin’ to have another powwow. Elk Valley is goin’
to be ’way over-populated before this day is done. I’ve got a hunch some
of the visitors are never goin’ to come back to the Rock—unless Doc
brings ’em.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXVIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>JOHNNY TALKS AT LAST</span>
</h2>

<p>Big Jim greeted Johnny with a laugh. People said that the district
attorney knew more and said less than any one in the county. A look of
almost infinite wisdom was in his eyes as he studied Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well,” he questioned, “you’re goin’ to bust if you don’t talk, Johnny?
Let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“You hit the nail, Jim. Talk—a big order of it—is what I want to git off
my mind.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had my ears open, Johnny,” Kelsey said. “I wondered when you’d
drop in.”</p>

<p>“You hain’t heard <i>nothin’</i>. You wait. I’ve found out a-plenty since I
started puttin’ my nose into other people’s business, as Gallup would
say. I’m here to ask for a warrant.”</p>

<p>“So? For whom?”</p>

<p>“For the coroner of this county—for the murder of Crosbie Traynor, same
having occurred on the night of October 4th in a room at the Palace
Hotel. You listen to me and see if I’m crazy or not. I suppose you heard
all the talk that was made the night we found the body? Well, I won’t
waste no time on that, but—I found the dead man’s horse. I went through
the saddlebags and I found a picture. Later, I got the dead man’s name.
I just kept on putting two and two together until I began to git scared
at what I was findin’ out. Git your pencil and make some notes.”</p>

<p>Kelsey did as Johnny asked, but he made small use of the pencil. His
mind grasped the facts as Johnny unfolded them. From time to time he
stopped the boy to insert a question. Whenever he did so, Johnny’s
answers invariably enabled him to leap ahead to the next move in this
game of life and death.</p>

<p>Sometimes Johnny raised questioning eyes as he wondered if he were
making himself understood. Kelsey merely grunted in the affirmative.
Once he whistled. Traynor’s letter to Molly caused that.</p>

<p>The boy knew his story grasped the man’s mind, for, shrewd as Kelsey
was, he could not keep all emotion from his eyes.</p>

<p>Johnny went on, bit by bit, until he had not only divulged his
information, but had convinced the attorney of the conclusions he had
drawn.</p>

<p>“Can I be wrong, Jim?” Johnny asked when he had finished.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. But you’ve got a house of cards. One absolutely
provable fact is all you need to make your evidence steel proof. I’m
willin’ to go ahead. I know Roddy, he ought to be recalled. Lord know’s
you’ve got more than enough to arrest them on suspicion, but I wouldn’t
do it that way. Charge Gallup with it. Facts come out in a trial that
you never dream of. We’ll arrest the whole clique—Gallup, Gale, Kent,
and even the Indian.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want Kent charged with murder,” Johnny stated. “Can’t we scare
him into turning on Gallup? Aaron’s the boy at the bottom of this pile.”</p>

<p>“If you feel that way about it, Johnny, why not wait? Gallup will trip
up if you give him time. Kent may put himself in the clear.”</p>

<p>“No waitin’ now, Jim. Trouble has caught right up with us. Roddy, Kent,
Gallup and some deputy are out gunning for me. They’ve got a warrant
chargin’ me with abductin’ Miss Molly. Havin’ done it once, they’ve
framed me into it again. It’s just a game. They’ve taken the girl
themselves. If Roddy gits a gun on me and I move a finger—good night—I’m
a dead man.”</p>

<p>Kelsey was on his feet. “We’ll go. You get Ritter, maybe Scanlon, too.
I’ll be at the hotel in fifteen minutes at the latest.”</p>

<p>“Come armed,” Johnny warned. “This is goin’ to be a battle. Gale is no
doubt on the Reservation. Gallup will bump him off if he gits a chance.
The same goes for the chief. It’s a nice little way to shut men’s
mouths. If we lose Gale or the Injun, we’re stuck.”</p>

<p>“That is not what I’m afraid of,” Kelsey answered. “Gallup is over his
head in going to Elk Valley. Thunder Bird has more power than you
suspect. Gallup has humiliated and shamed him. It’s the one thing the
old buck won’t overlook. You could put a regiment of troops in Elk
Valley and Gallup would still be in danger. When it comes to a matter of
tribal honor—look out! You can talk all you want to about civilization
and its effect on the poor, downtrodden Indian; but he’s got a kick left
in him still. Four or five men are all we need.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be you, me, Doc Ritter, Scanlon, and Charlie Paul. We’ll be
ready when you git there.”</p>

<p>It happened, however, that when Kelsey rode up Vin had not returned with
Charlie and Johnny’s horse. A few minutes later, though, they arrived.
The delay had allowed a crowd to form, for, in spite of Johnny’s demand
for secrecy, the news that a posse was being organized had spread.</p>

<p>Heavily armed, the five men rode out of the Rock. Soon after the town
was left behind, Kelsey held up his hand and brought them to a stop.</p>

<p>“Men,” said he, “you know what we’re going after. I hope we won’t have
to fire a shot. I hold that shooting that goes unpunished because it’s
within the letter of the law is almost as bad as though it weren’t. Law
ought to mean justice and a square deal to all; when it’s less than
that, I don’t want any of it. Let’s go!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>EVIDENCE TO CONVICT</span>
</h2>

<p>Johnny was leading the posse two hours later when he signaled to the
other men. “Rig comin’,” he called as they moved within hearing
distance. “Ought to pass it just about where the road forks. Let’s hit
it up a little.”</p>

<p>Riding in close formation, they began rapidly to diminish the distance
between themselves and the oncoming team.</p>

<p>“Driver asleep, him,” the keen-eyed Charlie called to Johnny.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but we’ll have to disturb him,” Johnny answered. “Better spread
out, boys. That team is runnin’.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes the team was almost up with them.</p>

<p>“Whoa, there!” Johnny cried, but the driver paid no attention to the
hail. “Look out!” the boy shouted to Doc Ritter. “I’ll yank ’em as they
go by.”</p>

<p>Whirling his horse, Johnny planted himself in the path of the galloping
team. A mad dive for a bridle strap, and he had the off horse on its
haunches. “Grab the gray, Charlie!” he cried to the Indian.</p>

<p>Charlie Paul’s hands shot out, and in another second the team was
halted. Johnny took a look at the driver, who had slipped to the floor
of the rig, his face blood-stained; blank, wide-open eyes staring up at
the sky.</p>

<p>“There you are, Jim,” Johnny shouted to Kelsey as he recognized the
blood-smeared face. “It’s Toby Gale! They got him, just as I said they
would.”</p>

<p>“God!” Kelsey moaned. “He’s all banged up, ain’t he? Give me a hand, and
we’ll get him out of the wagon.”</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ to die,” Doc Ritter announced after a hurried examination,
“but he’ll come back for a second or so before he goes. Somebody give me
some whiskey.”</p>

<p>Scanlon obliged, and between them they fanned the man’s dying spark of
life into a smoldering flame. Tobias eyed the five of them in turn.
Johnny held his gaze.</p>

<p>“Can you talk?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>Gale tried to move his lips, but no intelligent sound came from them.</p>

<p>“Wait, I’ll lift up his head a bit,” Doc volunteered.</p>

<p>Gale licked his lips. Seconds dragged by before he made a sound. When he
did speak it was in flat, lifeless tones. He was looking at Ritter. “I’m
dying, ain’t I, Doc?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty bad off,” Doc told him honestly.</p>

<p>Tobias just gazed helplessly at Ritter, searching the doctor’s face for
sign of the truth which he feared. The little man’s eyelids drew back
from the pupils of his eyes as he read his fate.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, Doc, I don’t want to die!” he moaned. “I’m afraid of it. I can
feel it coming on. It’s awful!”</p>

<p>An unearthly sound broke from his lips. Ritter forced more of the
whiskey down his throat. “Tell me what happened,” he demanded. “Who shot
you?”</p>

<p>Tobias shook his head slightly. “Let me talk, Ritter,” he muttered. “My
God, I’ve never talked. Let me have a chance now. You others go away. I
want to speak just to Johnny and Kelsey.”</p>

<p>“Better humor him,” Ritter advised as he got to his feet. “He’ll go in a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>Johnny and the district attorney nodded their heads and got to their
knees beside the dying man.</p>

<p>“What is it, Toby?” Johnny asked.</p>

<p>Toby stared at the boy for an interval before he answered. “You hate
Aaron Gallup even as I do,” he said at last. “That’s why I called for
you. Yes, I do hate him,” he repeated in answer to the question in the
boy’s eyes. “I’ve always hated him—but he’s got me.”</p>

<p>“Gallup shot you?”</p>

<p>“Aaron Gallup—get that straight. Roddy was with him. Roddy didn’t shoot,
though.</p>

<p>“I was going to the Reservation. I’d brought the chief in to see Gallup
last night—I’ll tell you why later. You know they had trouble. I was on
top the hotel. I saw you drive away with the old Indian. I got a team
and started after you about daylight.</p>

<p>“I got just about here when I saw four men coming fast. I thought they
were after me, and I raced the horses. The four of them split up at the
forks. Roddy and Gallup chased me. When I saw it was Gallup I was afraid
to stop. He yelled at me—so did the sheriff, but I kept on going.</p>

<p>“Gallup fired then. I must have turned around, for I saw his gun flash
again. I fell out of the rig, I remember, because I was on the ground
when I opened my eyes. Gallup was standing over me. ‘Guess you’ll stop
now,’ he said. ‘You can talk your damned head off if you want to. Won’t
be any one to hear you blabbin’ about me.’</p>

<p>“I let him know then that <i>I</i> had brought the chief to see him. Ha,
ha—it was almost worth getting killed to be able to tell him that. He
raised his foot and kicked me in the face, and riddled me again. He’s
got plenty to swing for, Kelsey. Not me alone, either. Johnny knows I’m
right about that. Due to me that man Traynor came to the Rock. I don’t
know how it happened, but Gallup or Kent killed him.”</p>

<p>Johnny and Kelsey flashed a glance at each other.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” Gale moaned. “I can’t breathe. Where’s that bottle?”</p>

<p>“Give him all he wants,” Ritter called to Johnny. “It won’t put him
under.”</p>

<p>Johnny had been staring at the man’s ragged chest, but he had to turn
his head away as the stimulant began to have an effect on Gale’s heart.</p>

<p>“I got to talk quick, don’t I?” Tobias asked. “Gallup ground me into the
dirt for years. I made up my mind to get square with him some time. He
was too cautious. I knew he had covered up something in his past. It
must have been two years before I got on the trail of what it was.</p>

<p>“I was on the Reservation one day. Thunder Bird was getting married
again. He was all decked out. Around his neck he had a chain of beads,
and hanging on the middle of it was a piece of a white man’s silver
watch chain. It was Mexican made, I guess—I’d only seen the like of it
once before; Gallup had such a chain, and it always looked to me as if
it had been broken off.</p>

<p>“I asked the chief where he got those links. He was on edge in a second.
I mentioned Gallup’s name. That floored him. I found out afterward that
he had not been in town for years, that he had no idea of Gallup’s
nearness. I made a good friend of the Indian. It took me a year or more
to piece together the story of Gallup’s past; but I got it. That was
three years ago.</p>

<p>“I managed it so that Thunder Bird got a look at Kent and Gallup. He
recognized them at a glance.</p>

<p>“I got busy hunting for Traynor. Took me until a month ago to find him.
When he came I was on the Reservation. I talked to him, and part of what
I’m going to tell you I got from him, the rest from the chief. Now, for
God’s sake don’t let me pass out until I’ve finished.”</p>

<p>Gale paused for a second or so. “Got to make it short,” he began again.
“It was down in Arizona. Traynor, Kent, and Gallup had a copper claim in
the Painted Desert. Traynor was married. Had a wife and baby girl living
in Flagstaff. All this happened nineteen or twenty years ago.</p>

<p>“Thunder Bird had skipped from the Reservation—some trouble growing out
of the Mormon raid—he was hiding out down around the Little Colorado.
Traynor hired him to freight supplies to their mine.</p>

<p>“The claim began to look so good that Gallup and Kent decided to get rid
of Traynor. They sent the Indian to town, and as soon as they were alone
the two of them jumped their man, hog-tied him and rolled him out in the
sun to die of thirst. Two days nearly finished him.</p>

<p>“Kent, then, loaded him on a mule and took him out north and left him
for the buzzards. They were in the clear—men dying right along like that
for want of water. They put up a fine show when the Indian returned.
Told him Traynor had been gone two days; that they had hunted for him
until their water gave out.</p>

<p>“It was a pat yarn, but the Indian noticed that broken watch chain and
found the piece Traynor had twisted off in the fight. That night he
stole what water there was in camp and went after the missing man. He
searched for days without finding him. A wandering band of Shewits had
picked up Traynor and carried him off to their village north of the
Virgin. Two months later Thunder Bird found him there.</p>

<p>“Traynor went back to Flagstaff, but Kent and Gallup were gone, also his
wife and child. Six or seven years elapsed before they showed up in this
country. Traynor’s wife had died. Kent claimed the girl for his
daughter.”</p>

<p>“You mean Molly?” Johnny gasped. “She ain’t Kent’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“No. Her right name is Molly Traynor. Traynor combed the West looking
for them. That’s why I couldn’t find him. Gallup had sold the mine for a
good price. Traynor managed to get a little out of it. I guess that
about tells it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Kent was shipping from the Rock this year or I would ’a’
warned Traynor. Gallup had left for Salt Lake to be gone a week. I
thought it was all right for the man to come into town.</p>

<p>“But both Gallup and Kent were here. I knew it that night when I got
back. I watched; I was sure there’d be trouble. I didn’t want Traynor
killed. I wanted to break Gallup. He knows how it was done, Kelsey. Make
him tell—make him talk. Promise me you’ll get him.”</p>

<p>“Johnny knows how Traynor was killed,” Kelsey answered. “If it’s any
comfort to you, you can bank on it that we’ll get Mr. Gallup—and he’ll
talk.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Johnny got to his feet in a daze, leaving it to Kelsey to close the dead
man’s eyes. The boy had easily grasped Gale’s dramatic story, but his
brain was so busily engaged in separating the many details into their
proper sequence that it was impossible for him to think clearly.</p>

<p>Out of the jumble of confused facts one thing came to overwhelm him.
Molly was not Kent’s daughter! That was his big surprise.</p>

<p>In a way, Gale’s story explained things about as Johnny had fancied
them. Beyond question Gallup had been the actual murderer. Kent was
almost equally guilty, though. Johnny realized how impossible it was
going to be to keep the cattleman from spending the rest of his days in
jail.</p>

<p>“Thank God, he ain’t her father!” he said to himself. “He’s guilty, and
he’ll have to pay for it.”</p>

<p>The other men were bunched about Kelsey, and Johnny heard him say:</p>

<p>“Gallup shot him. Gale had so much on the man that Gallup had to kill
him. Johnny had enough on Aaron to satisfy me; Tobias clinched it. He
swore that Jackson Kent and the coroner of this county killed Crosbie
Traynor—it was to hide a crime committed twenty years ago. It’s a
strange story, boys; but the thing to do now is to get going. We want
Kent and Gallup alive—remember that.”</p>

<p>“Best thing to do, I guess, is to unhitch the team, and put Gale back in
the rig and leave him here,” Doc suggested. “Did you notice this, Jim?
Gale’s gun? It’s been shot twice. He must have tried to get in a lick.”</p>

<p>“No,” Johnny cut in. “They fired it after they’d got him; threw it in
the wagon and gave the horses hell. If it hadn’t been for us Gale’s body
wouldn’t have been found until the team got to town. That would have
looked like suicide to a lot of people.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the way I figure it,” Kelsey agreed. “If you boys are
ready we’ll go.”</p>

<p>Johnny and the district attorney rode abreast as the party started on.</p>

<p>“Glad you didn’t say anythin’ about the girl,” the boy remarked. “I want
to save her all the misery I can.”</p>

<p>“I know, Johnny; but it’s not going to be possible to keep Kent out of
this. Most of the money he has belongs to her. She will get her share of
Gallup’s pile, too. The best thing to do is to come clean with the whole
story.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do that, Jim—not until you have to. Only for me
there wouldn’t have been a murmur. I nailed Gallup and Kent. Molly’s
happiness is all the reward I want. I’ve got a right to ask for that,
and I’m doin’ it now. I don’t know where she is, but I’ll find her. In
some way I’m goin’ to try and break this thing to her a little at a
time. She’s suffered enough these past weeks.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret, Johnny. And I want to give you a bit of advice. You can
take it or not. It’s well meant. You’ll find the girl. Kent wouldn’t
harm her. I think I know how things are between you; marry her—<i>at
once</i>. Get her down to San Francisco or Santa Cruz. After you’re there,
begin to tell her the truth. And remember this—when you come back
<i>don’t</i> go to the ranch. Get a house down in Winnemucca. Buy a car, and
you’ll be able to get back and forth from the ranch in no time.”</p>

<p>“That’s sure a gay future you’re paintin’ for me,” Johnny smiled
lugubriously. “All I got to do is to make her see it—takin’ me and all
the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to pay you a sincere compliment, Johnny—she couldn’t
pick a better man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pie!” Johnny exclaimed, ridiculing Kelsey’s words.</p>

<p>“Pie or cream puffs,” the attorney remonstrated, “it’s all the same with
me. I know what I know. When a man will play as hard as you play, I know
he’ll work when the playing days are over. The Diamond-Bar is a big
property. No matter what happens to Kent he’ll have to give the girl her
share. That’ll be a job for you. Preach it into Miss Molly that she must
start a clean slate. Old scenes bring back old memories, and old
memories haunt us. The past is past.”</p>

<p>Kelsey laughed to himself. “That’s the most talking I’ve done in a right
smart bit of time. No charges, either.”</p>

<p>Johnny smiled, too. “Well, at least I’m obliged to you, Jim,” he
drawled. “You’ve got <i>my</i> vote, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Scanlon, who had been riding ahead, drew up his horse and waited for the
others to come abreast him. “We’d better spread out,” he suggested. “If
they see us riding together it’s going to look suspicious. They don’t
know we’re after them. If each man goes it alone one of us is sure to
pick them up. Let the one that does string along until he meets another
man. Between the two of them they ought to get the drop.”</p>

<p>“You always did know how to draw to a hand, Scanlon,” Johnny answered
approvingly. “I say, break up right here.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Kelsey agreed. “Each of us understands what to do. I’ll
take the eastern cañon; Scanlon, you go straight ahead; Doc and Johnny
and Charlie Paul can spread out to the west and work north. We’ll meet
at the Agency by evening.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan they separated. In half an hour Johnny found
himself alone, crossing a narrowing plain between two broken ranges. The
Indian was on his left, Doc Ritter on his right. By noon time they were
miles apart.</p>

<p>The plain which Johnny had traversed came to an end. Before him arose
giant mountains. It was his intention to scale them and later on to
cross a high plateau to his north, eventually coming to the trail which
led to the post trader’s store.</p>

<p>The boy’s horse made slow progress during the next hour. Every foot of
the way was an uphill climb. On reaching a fairly level basin in the
mountainside Johnny stopped to let his pony get his wind. Reaching for
his tobacco and papers, Johnny began rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>The <i>zing-g-g-g</i> of a bullet terminated the operation very abruptly.
With a backward lunge the boy threw himself out of his saddle, and,
hugging the ground, wriggled to the cover of a giant bowlder. Ten yards
away he could see his hat, a neat little hole showing where the bullet
had passed through.</p>

<p>Not more than a second later, it seemed, another shot sounded. Johnny’s
head swung around to find the source of it. As he stared above him he
saw a man rise to his feet, sway for an instant as his gun dropped from
his hands, and sink back out of sight.</p>

<p>“It’s Kent!” Johnny gasped.</p>

<p>A voice called then:</p>

<p>“Hullo—Johnny! Hees all right for stand up. It’s me—Madeiras!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE DEATH CHANT</span>
</h2>

<p>“For God’s sake!” Johnny cried when he reached Madeiras. “What did you
kill him for?”</p>

<p>“Eet’s either you or heem. You t’ink I let heem pump lead into you like
that?”</p>

<p>“Have you been stalkin’ him?”</p>

<p>“I watch heem all right. Thunder Bird and feefty braves ees up beyond.
Gallup and Roddy ees on other side of mountain. You most t’ink eet was a
raid. Gallup die if he come close.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to stop that, Tony. Gale’s been shot. He confessed. Gallup
killed both him and Traynor. Kelsey and a posse are spread out in the
hills to git him. I been lookin’ my eyes out for you. Who told you I was
alive?”</p>

<p>“The chief. He tell me you want me.”</p>

<p>“You bet! Kent and Gallup have got Molly hidden somewhere. They swore
out a warrant for me, chargin’ I took her.”</p>

<p>Tony smiled very superiorly. “No,” he said. “They ain’t got her; me,
Tony Madeiras, has got the girl!”</p>

<p>“What? You stole her?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí!</i> I watch Gallup leave town las’ night. I lose time before I
follow, but I go pretty dam’ fas’ when I get started. I t’ink he ees go
to the ranch. I say I tak’ the girl before I let heem have her. <i>Por
Dios</i>, that girl hate me. I have fight to tak’ her away.” Tony shook his
head. “Such nice girl, Johnny—sometime I wish you not come back.”</p>

<p>“Well, where is she now?” Johnny demanded excitedly.</p>

<p>“Don’ worry; she’s safe—she’s in Thunder Bird’s lodge. Hees squaw ees
tak’ good care of her.”</p>

<p>“That’s no place for her, Tony. I don’t want her to know anythin’ about
what’s happenin’ today. You git behind me now and we’ll crawl over to
Kent. Look out; he may not be dead. He lost his rifle, but he may have a
pistol on him.”</p>

<p>“No need be afraid,” Tony assured Johnny. “I tak’ good aim.”</p>

<p>When they found Kent he was propped against a rock with a pistol in his
hand, but he was so far gone that he could not lift his arm to fire. “Go
’way,” he muttered. “Let me die in peace.”</p>

<p>“No, Kent,” answered Johnny. “Too many things have happened today to go
without a word with you. With all your faults I know you love Molly.
I’ve got to talk. Gale has been killed. He told the truth about you and
Gallup and Traynor. There’s a posse surroundin’ Gallup. They’ll git him
if Thunder Bird don’t.”</p>

<p>“You lyin’?” the old man questioned.</p>

<p>“I’ll prove that I ain’t,” the boy replied, and he retold part of Gale’s
story.</p>

<p>“You win,” Kent said at last. “I never should have opposed you. But I
ain’t afraid to die. Best that I do, I guess. Molly is against me. You
killed her love for me—and she did love me. Yes, she did! Won’t you fix
it some way, Johnny, so that she won’t know all—that—that she wasn’t my
girl?</p>

<p>“I ain’t taken a penny of her money. In fact, I’ve doubled what I got
out of the mine. It’s all hers. Gallup’s got my notes for thirty
thousand. He won’t be able to collect. That’s good, ain’t it—beatin’
him?</p>

<p>“He shot ‘Cross.’ Got him from the top of one of those box cars while I
was tryin’ to make an alibi for myself by sittin’ in Ritter’s office.
Think of him turnin’ on me after what we’d been through—tryin’ to take
Molly. God, I’m glad she’s free of him! Tell her you and me made it up,
Johnny—that I said I hoped you two’d be happy. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>The old man tried to lift his arm beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Don’t let her know about me—don’t tell her she wasn’t my child,” he
begged. “I raised her, Johnny—her little baby hands. I can feel them.”</p>

<p>In spite of Johnny’s efforts Kent forced himself half erect. “You’ve got
to promise me, do you hear?” he went on. “I couldn’t die if I thought
she was goin’ to know. I couldn’t, I tell you—I—I—couldn’t.”</p>

<p>He fell back before the boy could catch him. Madeiras put his ear to the
man’s chest.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” Johnny whispered to the Basque. “Yes, sir, the old man’s
gone! There’s all that’s left of Jackson Kent. Two months ago who’d ever
have thought it would come to this?”</p>

<p>Johnny got to his feet and walked to a bowlder and sat down. “I got so I
was hatin’ him,” he said to Tony, “and yet it kinda chokes me up to see
him lyin’ there like that. Things used to be pretty pleasant in the old
days on the range.”</p>

<p>Johnny’s words and the look on his face caused Madeiras more concern
than the sight of Kent’s lifeless body. Going to the boy’s side, he
placed his arm around his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Never min’, Johnny,” he said. “Kent try dam’ hard do ever’t’ing bad for
you. No reason for you mak’ me feel all bus’ up.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose there is; but I’m goin’ to try and do as he wished.
If the old man had been all bad he would have put Molly into some
institution and forgot her. Whatever he did that was wrong—he was good
to her. So don’t talk, Tony. These things square themselves in time.”</p>

<p>Johnny got up and covered Kent’s face.</p>

<p>“Where’s his horse?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Back where I lef’ mine,” Madeiras answered, pointing to a little park
of stunted cedars.</p>

<p>“No matter,” Johnny went on, “we got to leave him here or—say! We’ll
throw him on my horse and tote him to the trees. We can tie him up
between some of those cedars so the coyotes won’t be able to git at him.
Give me a hand; we got to git movin’.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the trees they put a rope around Kent’s body, and
passed the end of it through a noose in another rope which they had
looped over the top of one of the trees. By this arrangement they were
able to lift the body from the ground and raise it to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Johnny had knotted the ropes when he suddenly came to attention.
Madeiras glanced at him sharply.</p>

<p>“What ees eet?” the Basque asked.</p>

<p>Johnny had his hands cupped to his ears. “Listen,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Faint, far off, came the measured, significant sound which had alarmed
the boy. The Basque’s expression showed that he, too, heard it.</p>

<p>“Do you get it?” Johnny asked. “<i>Tum, tum, tu-um, tum, tum</i>—it’s a
finger drum.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí</i>,” Tony nodded, his voice dry, his hand keeping time with the beat.
“Eet’s the death chant. Old——”</p>

<p>“Thunder Bird’s got Gallup!” Johnny finished for the Basque. “<i>That’s</i>
what is waitin’ for us on the top of this mountain! All we got to do is
to go into that Piute camp and take Gallup away from them. And we’ve got
to do it with gab. I know Injuns. Every minute we wait here only makes
our chances slimmer. Believe me, if we’re goin’ to save Gallup—we’ve got
to travel.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXXII' title='XXXII: THE DEBT IS PAID'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXXII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE DEBT IS PAID</span>
</h2>

<p>A strange sight awaited Johnny and the Basque. Thunder Bird’s braves had
surprised Gallup and captured him. Roddy, his deputy—Sol Ahrens—and Kent
had bolted. So, without a shot having been fired, old Aaron had been
marched to the camp at the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>The rock formation looked very much as if it was of volcanic origin, a
huge crater or bowl having been carved out where the peak of the
mountain must once have risen. In this bowl was the Piute camp.</p>

<p>Johnny and Madeiras, from the point they had gained above the Indians,
were able to see what went on. Gallup was tied to a stake. Thunder Bird
sat facing him, and squatting in a circle about the doomed man were at
least fifty Indians. Two or three squaws moved around in back of the
circle, gathering rocks and depositing them in piles within reach of
their lords.</p>

<p>“They’re goin’ to stone him,” Johnny told the Basque. “It’s a good old
Piute trick.”</p>

<p>Gallup’s voice rose above the throbbing of the drum, but what he said
was not intelligible to the two men watching him. Thunder Bird sat
unmoved, gloating over the man before him, Aaron’s torrent of words only
adding to his enjoyment.</p>

<p>At a signal from one of the chief’s sons the squaws left their gathering
of rocks and approached the single lodge which had been erected. A brief
wrangling, and Johnny saw Molly step forth from the tent’s folds. Ten
seconds later the chief’s lodge fell in the dust. A brief moment of
labor and the Indian women had it strapped on a pony.</p>

<p>Johnny saw Thunder Bird raise his hand as Molly approached him. Plainly
he was exhibiting her to Gallup. The Indian’s sense of the dramatic was
superb. He intended that Aaron should think that he had stolen her.</p>

<p>Gallup turned his entreaties to Molly, but she seemed deaf to them.
Johnny saw her pick up a rock from the piles which the squaws had made.
She held it out questioningly toward old Thunder Bird. Rapid words
followed, the chief continuing to shake his head negatively.</p>

<p>Molly’s actions became vehement. The chief held up his hand to his
women. It ended the argument, for the next second Molly was being led
toward the distant crest of the large bowl.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t listen to her,” thought the boy. “She savvied those piles
of rock.” Aloud, then, he added:</p>

<p>“They’re sendin’ her away. It’s pretty refined of the old chief not to
make her witness what’s comin’ off.”</p>

<p>“Well, what we do now?” Tony asked. “You t’ink she’s any good for go
down there?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to try it,” Johnny answered. “You stay here. Maybe they won’t
let me come in to camp. If they do I’ll palaver and stall as long as I
can. Kelsey and the others will be showin’ up before long. They can’t be
asleep at the Agency to what is goin’ on. Ames is Injunwise. If these
braves git started the top is likely to blow off before they’re calmed
down again.”</p>

<p>“Bes’, I t’ink, to stay right here,” Tony stated firmly.</p>

<p>“And fail—after all my talkin’? Not on your life. I’m goin’ to git
Gallup, as I said I would. My luck ain’t so bad. Say, where’d you get
that trinket on the hat? That’s Traynor’s, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sí</i>. I get heem out of Gallup’s purse when he geeve eet to me for keel
you. That’s why I mak’ so much excitement. Maybe you tak’ eet.”</p>

<p>Tony offered the gold snake to Johnny, but the boy waved it back.</p>

<p>“No—I’ll play my own stuff. You watch me when I git down there. If I
hold up my hand, you shoot—fire two or three times. I’ll be tellin’ ’em
how many men I got around the rim. If the others arrive in time, maybe
they’ll understand, too.”</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Johnny moved away, Madeiras’s eyes following him.
When the boy was within two hundred yards of the camp the Basque saw him
raise his right hand, palm flat, above his head, his left hand, palm
pointing downward, dropping until it hung below his waist. It was the
Piute sign for a parley.</p>

<p>Johnny avoided any cover, lest it be thought that he stole up on them. A
few seconds later he was seen.</p>

<p>Contrary to the white man’s nice little laws, these Indians were armed.
Johnny caught the flash of the sun’s rays on the polished barrels, but
he continued to walk toward them. Thunder Bird turned his head in the
boy’s direction as he advanced.</p>

<p>Gallup had recognized Johnny, and he cursed him. Johnny ignored Aaron.
When he reached the chief’s side, the boy’s hands moved until the tips
of his fingers rested against his forehead. It was the sign of
friendship. The chief answered and motioned to Johnny to sit down.</p>

<p>Instead of complying, Johnny took the drum from the player’s hands, and,
holding it before Thunder Bird, dropped a handful of dust upon it. It
was symbolic—the omen of disaster. A murmur passed around the circle of
squatting Indians.</p>

<p>The old chief caught the boy’s meaning. “Nah!” he grunted angrily.</p>

<p>“My tongue speaks no lie,” Johnny answered flatly. “It is the drum of
death! Many men are in the hills. They are near. They no ask
question—just shoot.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird’s head moved back and forth assuredly. A sarcastic, mocking
grunt broke from his lips. “White men run,” he announced. “All gone.”</p>

<p>He referred to the other members of Gallup’s party. Not knowing this,
Johnny wondered if his play was doomed.</p>

<p>“Some go, many more come, chief,” he went on without a sign of wavering.
“Piute women rub ashes in their hair tonight. Me good friend with you,
Thunder Bird. Me tell um you, no take Gallup—white man want him. Man
Gale, he is dead; man Kent, he dead, too. Make talk—plenty talk. Big Jim
come. Many guns come with him. Mebbe so you remember Mormon fight?
Plenty Injun die; no fires in the lodges. Now come so happen again.”</p>

<p>And Johnny stooped and threw a handful of dust into his own face; from
his lips came the doleful notes of the chant for the dead.</p>

<p>Thunder Bird stirred uneasily. The boy, wisely, had made no demands.
What he had said had been only the airing of his sadness over the
calamity facing the tribe. His talk held truths as Thunder Bird knew—the
Mormon raid, for instance. Doubts for the safety of his band began to
assail the chief. He saw his braves staring at Johnny.</p>

<p>That individual was keenly alive to the fact that the issue hung in the
balance right now. If his bluff were called he would be in for it.</p>

<p>Bluff was one of Thunder Bird’s weapons also. He availed himself of it
now. “We keep Gallup,” he said. “No take away him. Men not come. If men
come, where they be?”</p>

<p>Johnny’s hand was being called. He did not flinch. With a look that said
a thousand men surrounded them he lifted his hand and began sweeping it
around the edge of the bowl. “They are there,” he said.</p>

<p>His hand pointed toward the spot where Madeiras lay. <i>Bang, bang, bang</i>,
came the sound of the Basque’s gun.</p>

<p>“There are many,” Johnny paused to say cautiously before his hand moved
onward. Was there any one else up there to answer him—Scanlon, Doc,
Kelsey? God help him if there was not. An eternity passed for the boy as
his hand started again and moved a foot without receiving an answer.
Johnny knew that he was taking the supreme gamble of his life. Another
few inches his hand moved, and then <i>bang, bang, bang</i> came the report
of a gun.</p>

<p>“Good old Doc Ritter,” Johnny murmured to himself, thinking he
recognized the sound of Doc’s heavy calibered weapon.</p>

<p>Johnny’s hand was sweeping along. Another series of shots rang out. A
pause then until his hand pointed in the very direction in which Molly
had gone. The next instant a fusillade of shots echoed in the basin.
Over the crest came a band of men—twenty-five or thirty of them.</p>

<p>“It is Ames and the agent!” Johnny cried aloud. “Thank God!” The boy had
no need to fear that his words had been overheard. The Indians were in a
panic. Only old Thunder Bird sat unmoved.</p>

<p>Johnny ran toward the oncoming men, his hands raised as he shouted to
them to put down their guns. By the time they met, Kelsey and Scanlon
were running down to them. A minute more and Ritter and Madeiras
appeared.</p>

<p>Ames had organized the party.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about, Johnny?” Ames asked. “I shore thought they wuz out
to raise ha’r.”</p>

<p>“They just wanted Gallup. He’s treated the chief as though he was a
water boy. When you hurt his dignity you’re hurtin’ somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Wal, you’d better untie Gallup,” Ames suggested. “He don’t look happy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him,” Kelsey announced. “I want him for murder.”</p>

<p>This statement caused some excitement among the trader’s party. Kelsey
explained briefly. “We’ll take him back to town,” he went on. “Maybe you
can find a horse for the old chief. Patch it up with him. I’ll want him
for a witness when this case comes to trial.”</p>

<p>Gallup had a tirade ready for Kelsey and the others as they approached
him. “’Bout time some one came,” he growled. “Injuns do about as they
please on the Reservation nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Aaron Gallup,” Kelsey interrupted, “I’ve got a warrant for your arrest.
You’re wanted for the murder of Crosbie Traynor.”</p>

<p>Gallup winced as if he had been shot. “Like hell I am,” he roared when
he recovered his breath. “That whipper-snapper there is at the bottom of
this!” And he hurled an oath at Johnny.</p>

<p>“That’s enough out of you, Gallup,” Kelsey snapped. “The boy got you,
all right. We’ve had Gale’s story also.”</p>

<p>“And Kent’s,” Johnny added. “He’s dead,” he continued in answer to Jim’s
question. “He tried to plug me; Tony stopped him. It was just as we had
it figured. Gallup shot Traynor from the top of a box car.”</p>

<p>“That’s goin’ to be right hard on the girl,” the trader exclaimed.
“Losin’ her paw thata-way. I took her and sent her down to my house just
a while back. The Injuns had her.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get her now,” Gallup sneered at Johnny, “You’re welcome to her.
What is she, anyhow? You think she’s——”</p>

<p>Madeiras had plucked a glowing faggot from a little “squaw” fire which
the Indians had made. He pressed it against Gallup’s mouth. “Wan more
word, Gallup,” he dared, “and I shove thees down your dam’, no-good
t’roat!”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird broke his silence long enough to grunt his approval of this
proposed action.</p>

<p>“You and Tony will be going with Ames,” Kelsey stated. “Our party will
go back the way you came, Johnny. Guess we’d better take Kent’s body
with us. Where’ll we find it?”</p>

<p>“In that little park of cedars soon after you start downhill.”</p>

<p>“Wal, we’ll git goin’ out of hyar,” Ames announced. “What about you,
chief? Better trail along.”</p>

<p>Thunder Bird shook his head.</p>

<p>“Suit yoreself. So-long, boys.”</p>

<p>Gallup, gloomy and sullen, got to his feet; the parties separated and
soon lost sight of each other.</p>

<p>“Never seen trouble come yit when the agent wuz home,” the trader
grumbled as they mounted their horses. “Reckon this is about Thunder
Bird’s last good time.”</p>

<p>Johnny found Molly sitting on the steps of the trader’s house when he
arrived at the Agency. Her face was proof enough of the worry and
excitement she had undergone. The boy’s heart sank as he realized that
he had to hurt her still more by the news he carried. Delay the telling
as long as he might, the truth had to be faced.</p>

<p>Johnny might have spared himself this misery, for Molly knew more than
he suspected, and explanations, which Johnny dreaded, were to be spared
him.</p>

<p>She ran toward him, arms outstretched, as he jumped down from his horse.
“Oh, Johnny,” she said sadly, “it’s been a terrible day. I think I’ll
break down completely if you don’t get me home at once. I was on the
ridge with Mr. Ames when you walked into Thunder Bird’s camp. I wasn’t
afraid for you. The chief had told me so many things this day that I
knew he was your friend. What did they do with Gallup?”</p>

<p>“They arrested him for the Traynor murder. Aaron shot Gale this mornin’,
and Toby confessed before he died.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t need that, though, from what I’ve been told, to convict him.
You proved your case against him. What a beast he has been. And—him—what
have they done with him?”</p>

<p>Although he suspected she referred to Kent, Johnny stared blankly at
Molly.</p>

<p>“I—I mean Kent,” she went on. “He was with Gallup this morning.”</p>

<p>“Why—er—he’s pretty bad off, I—er——”</p>

<p>“Is he dead, Johnny? Tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>Johnny nodded his head slowly. “Yes,” he muttered, “he’s dead. He tried
to kill me. Tony got him.”</p>

<p>Molly bit her lip in a vain effort to keep the tears back.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want you to know about your father, Molly,” the boy mumbled.</p>

<p>“No, Johnny,” Molly told him frankly. “There’s no need for you to fool
me longer. Thunder Bird told me. Crosbie Traynor was my father. No
wonder that I felt the call within me when I received his note.”</p>

<p>Johnny caught her as a sob broke from her lips. “Oh, Johnny,” she cried.
“Take me into your arms and pet me. I haven’t any one but you now!”</p>

<p>“I’ll git you away from here, Molly,” the boy told her. “We’re goin’ to
git married. You take some clothes and we’ll go down to California for
two or three months. Kelsey and Hobe will look after things; and Tony,
too, if you’ll let him. He’s blackened his good name and made you hate
him to help me. Don’t worry about tomorrow. They’ll keep on comin’ just
as regular as if nothin’ had ever happened. Time fixes up these hurts.”</p>

<p>It was even as Johnny said. Three months later, basking in the sunshine
of old Santa Cruz, Molly and Johnny agreed that happiness was just
beginning for them.</p>

<p>They had tried to keep their romance a secret, but the San Francisco
newspapers found them out. Although the young couple acted sedately
around the hotel, they realized, as brides and grooms always do, that
people knew they were honeymooners.</p>

<p>Johnny was sitting alone on the beach one evening, watching the
silver-tipped waves breaking over the wide sands of Monterey Bay, when
Molly stole up behind him and slipped her arms about his neck. He caught
her and held her until she paid a proper forfeit with her lips.</p>

<p>“Nice people do not kiss in public,” Molly said, teasingly.</p>

<p>“Well, you knew my past before you married me,” Johnny retorted with a
mischievous grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, did I—there!” And Molly kissed him again. “I’ve just received a
wonderful letter from Jim Kelsey. It’s full of good things about you.
Jim says he’s sorry he advised you to move out of the county. Folks want
to elect you to something or other.”</p>

<p>Johnny held up his hands in mock horror.</p>

<p>“No, sir, never again!” he declared. “I’ve got the job I was after.
Nevada will have to look out for herself.”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
